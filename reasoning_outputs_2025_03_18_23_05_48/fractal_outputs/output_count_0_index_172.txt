Fructose, also known as fruit sugar, is a type of sugar that is naturally present in fruits. It is a monosaccharide, meaning it is a single unit of sugar. Fructose is sweeter than glucose, another common sugar, and is often used in sweetening foods and beverages. In its natural form, fructose is found in fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes, and dates. It can also be added to foods as a sweetener, though it is important

Okay, so I'm trying to understand what quantum computing is. I know it's a big deal in technology and science, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me start by breaking down what I know and then see if I can figure out more.

First, I remember hearing that quantum computers use something called qubits instead of the regular bits that regular computers use. Bits are like the building blocks of computers, right? They can be 0 or 1, and by combining
