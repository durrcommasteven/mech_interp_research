Certainly! Here's a concise and clear response:

**Answer:**

Sure! Here's a brief explanation:

- **Definition:** A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- **Examples:** The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
- **Key Feature:** They can only be divided by 1 and themselves, making

Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the concept:

**"I" in the context of quantum mechanics refers to the quantum number that describes the number of particles at a specific energy level in an atom. It is a discrete value that can only take on specific whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on.**

For example:
- The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 electrons.
- The second energy level (n=2

**What is a Quadratic Equation?**

A quadratic equation is a type of polynomial equation of degree 2. It has the general form:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

where:
- \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants (coefficients),
- \( a \) cannot be zero (otherwise, it's not a quadratic equation),
- \( x \) is the variable.
