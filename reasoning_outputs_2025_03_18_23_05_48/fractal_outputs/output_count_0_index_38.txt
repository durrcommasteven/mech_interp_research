Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a program that can analyze a text file and determine if it's a book or not. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I guess I should understand what makes a text file a "book." Well, books usually have chapters, maybe with titles, and they often have a structure. So perhaps the program needs to check for things like chapter divisions, page breaks, or specific formatting. But wait

Alright, so I need to figure out how to explain why the sky is blue. I remember hearing this in school before, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Okay, so why is the sky blue during the day and black at night? Hmm, maybe it has something to do with the sun. The sun gives off light, right? But not all the colors of the sun reach Earth? Or is it something about the atmosphere

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using JavaScript. I'm pretty new to programming, so I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll give it a shot.

First, I know that a calculator typically has a display area and buttons for numbers and operations. So maybe I can create a simple HTML structure with a div for the display and another for the buttons. I remember that using CSS can help style these elements, so I'll probably need to set

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this math problem. It's about solving an equation with a variable in the denominator. The equation is (3x + 2)/(x - 1) = 5. Hmm, okay, so I have a rational equation here. I remember from class that solving these usually involves getting rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by the denominator. But I need to be careful because sometimes that can introduce extra solutions or mess things up if

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using Python. I've never done this before, but I know a bit about programming. Let me start by thinking about what a calculator does. It takes two numbers as input, adds them, subtracts, multiplies, and divides. So I need to create a program that can handle all these operations.

First, I should consider how to get the input from the user. In Python, I can use the input() function
