In the realm of artificial intelligence, the concept of a "general AI" refers to an intelligent system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. This is often contrasted with "narrow AI," which is designed for specific, limited tasks, such as voice recognition or playing chess.

### Key Characteristics of General AI:
1. **Self-Improvement**: General AI systems are capable of improving their own algorithms

A **linear equation** is an equation of the first degree, which means the highest power of the variable is 1. It typically takes the form:

\[ ax + b = c \]

Where:
- \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants.
- \( x \) is the variable.

### Steps to Solve a Linear Equation:
1. **Simplify the equation** if possible.
2. **Isolate the variable** \( x \) by

The term "quantum leap" is most commonly associated with physics, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, a quantum leap, or quantum jump, refers to the abrupt transition of a quantum system from one discrete energy state to another. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of quantum theory, where particles such as electrons in an atom can move between energy levels without passing through the intermediate states.

In simpler terms, a quantum leap means that a particle changes its energy state instantaneously.
