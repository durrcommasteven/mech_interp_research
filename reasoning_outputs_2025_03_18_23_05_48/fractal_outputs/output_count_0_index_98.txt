Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0 \). Alright, let's start by understanding what this equation is. It's a quadratic equation because the highest power of x is 2. Quadratic equations usually have the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where a, b, and c are constants. In this case, a is 2, b is

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read it again carefully.

"Given that the sum of two numbers is 10 and the difference of their squares is 24, find the two numbers."

Okay, so we have two numbers, let's call them x and y. The first piece of information is that their sum is 10. So, I can write that as:

x + y = 10

The second piece is that the difference

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x² + 5x + 3 = 0. Alright, let's start by understanding what this equation is. It's a quadratic equation because the highest power of x is 2. I remember that quadratic equations have the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. In this case, a is 2, b is 5, and

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 \). Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember from school that there are a few ways to solve quadratic equations. The first method is factoring, the second is completing the square, and the third is using the quadratic formula. I wonder which one will work best here.

Let me try factoring first. The equation is \( 2

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation 3x + 4 = 20. Hmm, let's see. I remember from school that when you have an equation like this, you want to get x by itself on one side. So, first, maybe I should subtract 4 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. That would leave me with 3x = 20 - 4, which is 16
