Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \). Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I know that this is a linear equation, and I need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

Alright, starting with the equation:

\( 2x + 4 = 10 \)

I remember that to solve for \( x \), I need to isolate it

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a circle. Hmm, I remember that the area of a circle is related to its radius. Let me think. I think the formula involves pi. Pi is approximately 3.1416, right? So, the area formula must be something like A equals pi times the radius squared. Yeah, that sounds familiar.

Wait, let me make sure. So, if the radius is 'r', then the area A is

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to write a Python function that can detect when a user is being sarcastic or using irony in their input. That sounds pretty challenging because sarcasm and irony can come in many forms and aren't always straightforward to detect programmatically.

First, I need to understand what sarcasm and irony are. Sarcasm is often meant to mock or convey contempt, and it's delivered in a way that's clearly insincere. Irony, on

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that the area of a shape is basically how much space it takes up. For a rectangle, it's a bit simpler because all the angles are right angles, so it's just a quadrilateral with opposite sides equal.

Okay, so I think the formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. Yeah, that sounds right. So if I have a rectangle that's,

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem: "Prove that there exists a function f: R → R such that f(x) = 0 for all x in R, and f is differentiable, but f' doesn't exist at some point in R." Hmm, that's interesting. At first glance, it seems a bit contradictory because if f(x) is zero everywhere, then its derivative should also be zero everywhere, right? But the problem is
