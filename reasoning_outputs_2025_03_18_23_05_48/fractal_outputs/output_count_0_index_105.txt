The term "quantum leap" is often used in physics to describe a sudden, dramatic change in the state of a physical system. It is particularly associated with quantum mechanics, where particles like electrons or photons can transition between discrete energy levels. This phenomenon is well-known for its connection to the concept of wavefunction collapse and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

In everyday language, "quantum leap" is sometimes used metaphorically to describe a significant, sudden change in a non-physical context,

Sure! Let's break down the process of creating a simple To-Do List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript step by step.

### Step 1: Set Up the HTML Structure
We'll start by creating a basic HTML structure with a container for the To-Do List.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the equation \(2x + 5 = 10\):

1. **Start with the equation:**
   \[
   2x + 5 = 10
   \]

2. **Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying this
