Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation 2x + 4 equals 3 times (x minus 2). Hmm, okay. Let me start by writing down the equation clearly: 2x + 4 = 3(x - 2). 

First, I remember that to solve for x, I should probably get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So, maybe I can start by distributing the 3

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that can recognize when someone is lying. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky because I know lying isn't something that can be detected with perfect accuracy. But I guess the function should try its best using some common indicators of deception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably start by understanding the different ways people lie. Maybe there are certain patterns in their speech or behavior that give them away. I remember

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write a program that can generate all possible subsets of a given set. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in math, a subset is any set that contains elements from the original set, including the empty set and the set itself. So, for example, if I have a set with elements {1, 2, 3}, the subsets would be all the possible combinations of these elements, right?

Wait, but how do I

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says, "What is 3/4 times 5/6?" Hmm, alright. I remember from math class that when you have two fractions and you want to multiply them, you just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, for 3/4 times 5/6, I think it would be (3*5)/(4*6). Let me write that down:

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0 \). Okay, let's start by recalling what I know about solving quadratic equations. Quadratic equations are of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and there are a few methods to solve them: factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. I'm not sure which method is the best here, so
