Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have some basic knowledge, but I'm not entirely sure how to put it all together. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that a calculator typically has a display screen where numbers are shown and buttons for numbers and operations. So, I need to create that structure with HTML. I'll probably use a div for the calculator itself, and inside it, another

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this math problem. It's about a triangle with sides of lengths 5, 12, and 13. Hmm, I remember that 5, 12, 13 is a Pythagorean triple, so maybe it's a right-angled triangle. Let me check that first. If it's a right triangle, then 5 squared plus 12 squared should equal 13 squared. 

Calculating that: 5²

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm pretty new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me start by recalling what each of these technologies does.

HTML is used to structure web pages, right? So I'll need to create the basic structure of the calculator, like the buttons and display area. CSS is for styling, which means making it look nice and consistent. JavaScript will handle the logic,

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x + 4y = 23. I'm not too confident with my algebra skills, but I'll give it a shot. First, I think I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy this equation. But wait, there are two variables here, so I probably need another equation to solve for both. Hmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other? Let me think

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to make a paper airplane. I remember my friend showed me this cool design once, but I can't quite recall all the steps. Let me see if I can work this out step by step. First, I think you start with a piece of paper. Maybe A4 size? I'm not sure, but I guess any standard paper should work. 

Alright, so if I lay the paper flat on the table, I need to fold it
