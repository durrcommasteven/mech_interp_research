Francesco di Giacomo Pellegrini, an Italian painter known for his intricate and emotionally charged works, was born on January 25, 1699, in Venice, Italy. His artistic journey began during a period marked by the Baroque movement's dominance in Europe, which emphasized dramatic compositions, rich colors, and dynamic movement. Pellegrini's work often reflected the spiritual and emotional depth of the Counter-Reformation, as seen in his religious-themed paintings.

Fructose, a type of sugar, is a monosaccharide that exists in two primary forms: **fructose** (in its linear form) and **mannose** (in its furanose form). Both are found naturally in plants, fruits, and honey. Fructose is also known for its role in glycolysis, where it serves as an energy source for red blood cells.

### Key Points:
1. **Structure**: Fructose has a pentose ring (five

A **finite automaton** is a mathematical model consisting of a finite number of **states** and **transitions** between these states. It is a simple type of automaton that can be represented using a finite number of states and a finite number of transitions, making it a powerful tool for modeling systems with limited complexity.

### Key Components of a Finite Automaton:
1. **States (Q):** These are the distinct states of the automaton, often represented by letters or symbols. For

Fructose, a type of sugar, is a monosaccharide with the chemical formula CH₂O. It is a simple carbohydrate that can be found in various natural sources such as fruits, honey, and sweetened beverages. Fructose is also known as fruit sugar and is often used in food production and baking due to its sweetness and compatibility with a wide range of ingredients.

Key characteristics of fructose include:
1. **Sweetness**: Fructose is sweeter than glucose, which is

A **fractal** is a mathematical shape that can be split into smaller, self-similar copies of itself, often with infinite complexity. Fractals are found in various fields, including mathematics, science, art, and music. Here are some key characteristics of fractals:

1. **Self-Similarity**: Fractals have the same shape at different scales, meaning they look the same no matter how much you zoom in or out.

2. **Repetition**: They can be created
