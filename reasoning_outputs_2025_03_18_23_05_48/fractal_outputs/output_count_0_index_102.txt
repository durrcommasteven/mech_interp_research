Fructose is a type of sugar that is found in fruits and can also be obtained from honey. It is a simple carbohydrate, which means it is a monosaccharide and consists of a single ring structure with five carbon atoms. Fructose is unique because, unlike glucose, it is not an aldose; instead, it is a ketose. This structural difference affects how the body metabolizes fructose compared to glucose.

One of the key differences between fructose and glucose is their metabolism

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the problem where I need to show that the sum of 1/n! from n=0 to infinity is equal to e. I've heard that e is the base of the natural logarithm and it's approximately 2.71828, but I'm not entirely sure how to connect the series 1/n! to e. 

First, I remember that e can be expressed as a power series. I think it's something like

Fructose, a type of sugar, is found in various natural foods such as fruits, honey, and sugar cane. It is a key component in the formation of sucrose, a disaccharide that is a major source of energy for plants and animals. In the human body, fructose is absorbed through the intestines and transported to the liver, where it is converted into glucose for energy. However, an overconsumption of fructose can lead to health issues, such as insulin resistance
