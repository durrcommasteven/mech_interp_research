Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \):

1. **Start with the given equation:**
   \[
   2x + 4 = 10
   \]

2. **Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x - 2 = 5x + 6 \).

**Step 1:** Start with the given equation:
\[ 3x - 2 = 5x + 6 \]

**Step 2:** Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to get the variables on one side:
\[ 3x - 5

Sure, here's a simple step-by-step guide to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:

### Step 1: Understand the Euclidean Algorithm
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two integers. It works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, where the larger number is divided by the smaller one, and the remainder is then used in the next step.

### Step 2: Apply the Division Algorithm
