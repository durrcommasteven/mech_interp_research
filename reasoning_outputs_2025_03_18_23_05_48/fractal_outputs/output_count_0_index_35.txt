Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3x² + 4x - 5 = 0. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what I know about quadratic equations. I remember that a quadratic equation is in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, and there are ways to solve for x, like factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. 

First, I should check if this equation can be fact

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking about the number of possible ways to arrange the letters in the word "BANANA" when some letters are repeated. Okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with permutations of letters where there are repeated elements, the formula is a bit different from when all letters are unique. I think the general formula is the factorial of the total number of letters divided

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using JavaScript. I've never done this before, but I know a bit about programming. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I know that a calculator typically has a display screen and buttons for numbers and operations. Since I'm using JavaScript, maybe I can create this using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling, and then JavaScript for the functionality.

Let me start by outlining what I need:

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x² + 4x - 5 = 0. I've seen quadratic equations before, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach solving this one. Let me think about the steps I should take.

First, I remember that quadratic equations are in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are coefficients. In this case, a is 3

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a regular polygon. I remember that a regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal, so that should make things a bit easier. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Let me think.

I know that for a regular polygon with 'n' sides, each side has the same length, let's call it 's'. The area, I think, can be found if I know the apothem
