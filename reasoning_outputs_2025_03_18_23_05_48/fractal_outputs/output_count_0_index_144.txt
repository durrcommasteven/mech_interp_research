Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where I need to find the value of a variable, let's say it's x, in an equation. The equation isn't provided directly, but from the context, it seems like it's a linear equation because the user mentioned something about solving for x by isolating it on one side. I remember from algebra that linear equations usually have variables on both sides, and you have to perform operations to get x by itself.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² - 3x + 4 = 0. Hmm, okay, quadratic equations. I remember from school that there are a few ways to solve them. Maybe I can try factoring first? Let me see if that works here.

So, the equation is 2x² - 3x + 4 = 0. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem: "Prove that the sum of the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (n^2 + 1)/(n^3 + 1) is equal to 3/2." Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that series can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write out the series to see if I can spot a pattern or something.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3x² + 4x + 1 = 0 using the quadratic formula. Hmm, I remember that the quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. Let me make sure I have that right. Yeah, so in this equation, the coefficients are a=3, b=4, and c=1. 

Alright

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² + 3x + 1 = 0. I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me see if I can recall how that works.

First, the standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0. In this case, a is 2, b is
