Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their prime factorization:

### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization
First, break down each number into its prime factors.

- For example, let’s take the numbers **12** and **18**.
- **12** can be factored into \(2^2 \times 3^1\).
- **18** can be factored into

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \):

1. **Start with the equation:**
   \[
   2x + 4 = 10
   \]

2. **Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4
