Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've never done this before, but I know the basics of each language. Let me start by breaking it down.

First, I need to create the structure of the calculator. I'll probably use a container div to hold everything. Inside that, there should be a display area where the numbers will show up. Then, I'll need buttons for numbers and operations. I think

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3 times (2x minus 5) equals 4. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I know that when you have parentheses in an equation like this, you should probably use the distributive property to get rid of them. The distributive property is where you multiply the number outside the parentheses by each term inside. So in this case, the number outside is 3, and inside

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. But how do I find its area? I think it involves multiplying something. Maybe the length and the width? Let me think.

So, if I have a rectangle, the area should be the space it occupies inside a plane. I guess that's why we use length and width because those are the dimensions

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a circle. Hmm, I remember that the area of a circle is related to its radius. But wait, how exactly? I think it involves pi, right? Let me try to recall the formula. I believe it's something like A equals pi times the radius squared. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, A = πr². 

But why is that the case? Maybe I should think about it more deeply

Alright, the user is asking about the best way to clean their car's engine. I should start by considering the different parts of the engine that need attention.

First, the engine block is important. It gets pretty dirty, so I'll need to suggest using a cleaner that's safe for engines. Maybe something like Goo Gone or a similar product.

Next, the air filter is another key component. It can accumulate a lot of dirt and dust, so replacing it regularly is crucial. I
