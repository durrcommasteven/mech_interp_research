Sure! Here's a brief explanation:

1. **What is a Graph?**  
   A graph is a mathematical representation of a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) and the relationships or connections between them (called edges). These relationships can be represented as lines or curves connecting the vertices.

2. **Types of Graphs**  
   - **Directed Graphs**: Edges have a direction (e.g., A points to B, but B doesn't necessarily point back).

Of course! Here's a concise and clear explanation:

**What is the derivative?**

The derivative of a function measures how the function changes as its input changes. It's a fundamental concept in calculus and is used to find the rate of change, slope, or inclination of the function at any given point.

**How is the derivative calculated?**

The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) is defined as:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to
