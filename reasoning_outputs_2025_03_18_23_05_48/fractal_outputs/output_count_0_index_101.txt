Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that can detect when a user is typing something, and then determine if the text they're entering is about a specific topic, like a product, service, or brand. The user mentioned using the `keyboard` module, which I think allows the program to detect key presses. They also mentioned using `pyautogui` to take screenshots of the active window, which can help in determining the active application or the text being entered.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python program that can process some text and then output a specific result. The user mentioned using the `sys` module for input and `os` for file handling, and also using string manipulation with `str` operations. They also included some example code that reads a file, processes each line, and then outputs a line with the line number and the text. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what

Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to use the Law of Cosines. I remember in geometry class, my teacher mentioned it was useful for finding the lengths of sides when you know two sides and the included angle. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula and how to apply it. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the Law of Cosines is part of the Law of Cosines theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle

Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to calculate the exact number of solutions for a system of equations. The problem given is:

Calculate the exact number of solutions for the system:

1. \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 = 32 \)

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with systems of equations, especially polynomial ones, substitution or elimination can be useful methods. But here, the equations

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a program that can convert text from one language to another. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down. First, I think I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want a step-by-step explanation, so I should outline each part of the process clearly.

Alright, step one is identifying the source and target languages. That makes sense because without knowing which languages I'm dealing with, I can
