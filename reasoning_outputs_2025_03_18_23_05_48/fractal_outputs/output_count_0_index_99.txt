Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the area of a regular polygon. I remember that a regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal, so it should be symmetrical. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Let me think.

First, I recall that the area of a regular polygon can be found using the formula:

Area = (Perimeter × Apothem) / 2

Hmm, that makes sense because it's similar to the area

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation 3x + 2 = 15. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to get x by itself on one side. 

First, maybe I should subtract 2 from both sides to get rid of the +2. So, if I do that, it would be 3x + 2 - 2 equals 15 - 2

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2\sin\theta + \cos\theta = 1 \). Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that equations involving both sine and cosine can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can rewrite them in terms of a single trigonometric function. I recall that there's an identity that allows you to express both sine and cosine in terms of tangent, which is \(

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x + 2 = 5. Okay, let me start by understanding what the equation is saying. It's saying that three times some number x, plus two, equals five. My goal is to find out what x is. 

First, I think I should isolate x on one side of the equation. That usually helps in solving for a variable. So, how do I do that? Well, the

Alright, so I have to figure out how to solve the equation 2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0. Hmm, okay. I remember that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, but maybe I should try factoring first because that might be simpler if the equation factors nicely.

Let me see, the equation is 2x² + 3x + 1 = 0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to (
