Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \):

1. **Start with the given equation:**
   \[
   2x + 4 = 10
   \]

2. **Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4

Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them. For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12 because 12 is the smallest number that both 4 and 6 divide into without leaving a remainder.
