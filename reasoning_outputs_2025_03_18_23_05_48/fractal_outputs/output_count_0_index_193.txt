Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is: Given that the sum of 3 consecutive numbers is 15, find the numbers. Also, if the sum of 4 consecutive numbers is 20, find those numbers. Additionally, I need to explain the method used in both cases.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. I think I should handle each part separately, starting with the first one:

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal and all angles are right angles. But how do I find the area? I think it has something to do with length and width.

Wait, yes! I recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So if I have the dimensions, like the length and the width, I just multiply them together.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( x^4 + 4y = 8 \). Hmm, okay. Let me start by trying to understand what the equation is asking. It's a fourth-degree equation in terms of x, which seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it to make it easier to solve.

First, I'll try to isolate x. If I subtract 4y from both sides, I get \( x^4

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x² + 5x + 3 = 0. Hmm, okay, I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. Let me recall what that is. I think it's something like x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. Yeah, that sounds right.

So, in this equation, 2x

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple website using HTML and CSS. I've heard that HTML is for structure and CSS is for styling, but I'm not exactly sure how they work together. Let me start by recalling what I know.

First, HTML uses tags to define the content on a webpage. The basic structure includes a doctype, html tag, head, and body. The doctype tells the browser what type of document it's looking at. The html
