Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns the sum of their elements. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in Python, adding two lists together isn't as simple as using the plus operator because that's for concatenating them. Instead, I think I need to loop through each element of both lists and add them up.

Wait, so if I have list1 = [1, 2, 3] and

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 \). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that solving quadratic equations usually involves using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let me check if this equation can be factored easily.

First, I'll look at the coefficients: 2, 3, and -2. I need two

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 5. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to isolate the variable, which in this case is x. That means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.

First, I think I should deal with the 2x term. To get rid of that, I can subtract 3 from

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² + 3x + 1 = 0. Hmm, I remember from algebra that this is a quadratic equation, which means it's of the form ax² + bx + c = 0. In this case, a is 2, b is 3, and c is 1. 

I think the first step is to see if I can factor this equation. Factoring quadr

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3x - 2y = 14. Hmm, I've seen equations like this before in algebra. They look like linear equations with two variables, x and y. I remember that to solve for one variable, you can use either substitution or elimination. Let me think about which method would work better here.

Looking at the equation 3x - 2y = 14, I notice that the coefficients are
