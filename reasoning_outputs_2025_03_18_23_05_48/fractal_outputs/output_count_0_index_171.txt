**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

To determine the value of \( 2^x + 2^y \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - You are given an expression \( 2^x + 2^y \).
   - \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers, meaning they can be 0,

A **quantum computer** is a computer that uses quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers that use binary bits (0s and 1s) to store information, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states (both 0 and 1 simultaneously). This unique property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much more efficiently than classical computers, particularly for tasks related to **quantum mechanics** and **number theory**.

Sure! Let me walk you through the process step by step.

### 1. **Understand the Problem**
   - You want to calculate the sum of a series of numbers.
   - The series is defined by a starting number, a common difference, and a specific number of terms.

### 2. **Identify the Formula**
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
     \[

**What is the relationship between the area of a rectangle and its perimeter?**

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, while the perimeter is the sum of all its sides. Here's the mathematical relationship:

- **Area (A):** \( A = length \times width \)
- **Perimeter (P):** \( P = 2 \times (length + width) \)

However, the area and perimeter are related in terms of their units
