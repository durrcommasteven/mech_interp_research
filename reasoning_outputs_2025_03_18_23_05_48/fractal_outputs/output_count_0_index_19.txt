Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² + 4x + 2 = 0. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what I know about quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, right? So in this case, a is 2, b is 4, and c is 2.

I think the first step is to see if I can factor this equation

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says that in a certain country, the number of people who die from the flu each year is 30,000, and the number of people who die from pneumonia is 20,000. Then, it mentions that these two causes of death together account for 50% of all deaths in the country. I need to find out what the total number of deaths in the country is each year, assuming that the

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a trapezoid. I remember that a trapezoid is a four-sided shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. Those parallel sides are called the bases, and the distance between them is the height. Okay, so the formula for the area of a trapezoid must involve the lengths of these two bases and the height.

Let me think... I think the formula is something like the average of

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to make a calculator that can handle complex numbers. I've heard that complex numbers are like numbers with a real part and an imaginary part, right? So, for example, something like 3 + 4i where i is the square root of -1. Cool, but how do I actually do the arithmetic with them?

First, I remember that when adding or subtracting complex numbers, you just add or subtract the real parts and the

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a circle. I remember from school that the area of a circle has something to do with π and the radius. But wait, what exactly is a radius? Let me think. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. It's like the length of the line from the center to the edge.

So, if I have a circle with a radius of, say, 5
