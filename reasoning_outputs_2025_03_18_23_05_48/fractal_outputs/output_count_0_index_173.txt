Fructose, a type of sugar, is naturally present in various foods such as fruits, vegetables, and honey. It is also added to processed foods as a sweetener. The body metabolizes fructose, but unlike glucose, it does not directly convert into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that holds energy in cells. Instead, fructose is broken down into other molecules like pyruvate, which can contribute to energy production, but this process is less efficient compared to
