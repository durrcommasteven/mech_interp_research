Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator. I'm not very experienced with programming, but I know a bit about JavaScript. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I want the calculator to have a display area where the numbers will show up. I remember that in HTML, I can create a div element and style it to look like a text input. Maybe I can use a text input so it's easy to update the display.

Next, I

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the work done by a force moving an object over a distance, but I'm a bit confused about the formula. I remember that work is related to force and distance, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Let me think about what I know.

I think work has something to do with force multiplied by distance, but I also remember hearing that it's not just F times d because the angle between the force and the direction

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says, "If a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc, then a + b + c = 0." Hmm, I remember something about this from algebra. I think it's called the identity or something related to cubes. Let me think.

First, I recall that there's an identity for the sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 + c^3

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0. I remember that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because that's usually the simplest method if it works.

Looking at the equation 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0, I notice that the coefficient of x² is 2. To

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \). Hmm, I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because it seems simpler if the equation factors nicely.

Looking at \( 2x^2 + 3x + 1 \), I want to find two numbers that multiply to \(
