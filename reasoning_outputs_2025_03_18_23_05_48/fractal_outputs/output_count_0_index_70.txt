Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the area of a trapezoid. I remember that a trapezoid is a four-sided shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. Those parallel sides are called the bases, and the distance between them is the height. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think this through step by step.

First, I recall that the area of a trapezoid is related to the lengths of

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. It's about a triangle with sides of lengths 5, 12, and 13. Hmm, I remember that 5-12-13 is a Pythagorean triple, which means it's a right-angled triangle. Let me confirm that first. If it's a right triangle, then the sides should satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\),

Okay, so I'm trying to understand this problem about the number of ways to distribute identical balls into distinct boxes. The problem states that there are n identical balls and k distinct boxes, and we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes. The formula given is the sum from i=0 to k of (k + 1 choose i) times the sum from j=1 to n of (n + 1 choose j), and it's said that this equals

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I remember that HTML is used for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with the HTML structure. I know I need a display area where the numbers and results will show up. So maybe a div element with an id like "display" where I can append text later. Also, I need buttons for

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I know that this is a linear equation, and I need to solve for x. That means I have to isolate x on one side of the equation. 

Alright, so the equation is 2x plus 5 equals 15. I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to get rid of the
