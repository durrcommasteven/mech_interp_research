Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a triangle when I know the lengths of all three sides. I remember that Heron's formula is used for this purpose, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me try to recall and work through it step by step.

First, I think Heron's formula involves the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter, usually denoted by 's', is half of the sum of all

Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator. Hmm, where do I even start? I remember from school that a calculator usually has basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Maybe I can use buttons to represent each operation and a display screen to show the numbers. But wait, how do I actually make the buttons and the display? I guess I can use HTML for the buttons and CSS to style them, but then what about the functionality? Oh

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember from school that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal, and all angles are right angles. But how do I actually find the area? I think it involves length and width, right? 

Wait, so the formula for area is something like length multiplied by width. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So if I have a rectangle that's, say, 4 units long and 5

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x² + 5x + 3 = 0. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what this equation is. It's a quadratic equation because the highest power of x is 2. Quadratic equations usually have two solutions, which can be found using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

First, I remember that a quadratic equation is in the form ax² + bx +

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x + 3y = 45. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I know. I remember that equations like this are called linear equations, and they usually have one solution unless the lines are parallel or something. But I don't think that's the case here because the coefficients aren't multiples of each other. So, I guess there's going to be a unique solution for x and y.
