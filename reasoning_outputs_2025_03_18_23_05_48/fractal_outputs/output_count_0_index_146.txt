Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I remember that the area of a rectangle is related to its length and width, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Okay, so a rectangle has two dimensions: length and width. I think the area is just the product of these two dimensions. So, if I have a rectangle that's, say, 5 units long and 4 units wide, the area would

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in that list. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in Python, you can loop through a list using a for loop. So maybe I'll start by initializing a variable to keep track of the sum, like total_sum = 0. Then, I'll loop through each number in the list. For each number, I'll check if it

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the sum of the first n even numbers. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that even numbers are like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. So the first few even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc. 

Wait, how do these even numbers form a sequence? Well, each even number is 2 more than the previous

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3x + 4y = 12. Hmm, okay, I remember from class that this is a linear equation with two variables, x and y. To solve it, I think I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the equation. But wait, how do I do that? I think there are a couple of methods. One is substitution, and the other is elimination. Which one should I

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where I need to find the value of x in the equation. The equation is given as 2 times the square root of (x minus 2) plus 3 equals 2 times the square root of (x minus 2) minus 3. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance because both sides have similar terms. Let me write it down to make it clearer.

So, the equation is:
