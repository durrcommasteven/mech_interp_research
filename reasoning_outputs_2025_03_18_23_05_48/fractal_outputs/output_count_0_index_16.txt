Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the problem where I have to find the sum of a series. The series is given by the sum from n equals 1 to infinity of a_n, where a_n is equal to (1/n^2) times the sum from k equals 1 to n of k squared. Hmm, okay, let me write that down to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, the series is Σ (from n=1 to �

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² + 3x - 2 = 0. I remember from school that quadratic equations can have two solutions, but I'm not exactly sure how to find them. Let me think about the different methods I know for solving quadratics.

First, there's factoring. I think that's when you try to break down the equation into two binomials that multiply to give the original equation.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3x + 2y = 37. Hmm, I remember from algebra that this is a linear equation with two variables. Usually, to solve for two variables, you need two equations, but here there's only one. So, I guess that means there are infinitely many solutions, right? Because with just one equation, x and y can take any values that satisfy the equation.

But wait, maybe I can express

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation \(2^x + 3^x = 5^x\). Hmm, this looks like an exponential equation. I remember that exponential equations can sometimes be tricky because they involve exponents with the same variable in the power. I wonder if there's a way to manipulate this equation to make it easier to solve.

First, maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for x to see if I

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3 times (x minus 2) equals 5 times (x minus 3). Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. So, it's 3(x - 2) = 5(x - 3). Alright, I think I need to solve for x here. 

First, maybe I should expand both sides of the equation. That means distributing the 3 and the
