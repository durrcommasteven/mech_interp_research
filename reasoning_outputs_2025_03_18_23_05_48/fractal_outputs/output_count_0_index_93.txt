First, I know that in Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. So I'll start by writing a function definition. The function should probably take one parameter, which is

Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to approach this problem where I need to calculate the time it takes for a group of people to complete a task, considering their individual rates. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with work rates, each person's rate is usually expressed as a fraction of the task they can complete in one unit of time, often one hour. For example, if someone can complete the task in 2 hours, their rate would
