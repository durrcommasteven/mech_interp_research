A **time complexity** is a formal measure of the amount of time taken by a program to execute a specific sequence of instructions. It is denoted as \( O(n) \), \( O(n^2) \), \( O(n^3) \), etc., where \( n \) is the number of operations or the number of elements in the input.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes to run

A **sieve of Eratosthenes** is a mathematical algorithm used to find all the prime numbers up to a specified integer \( n \). It is one of the most efficient ways to generate prime numbers and is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the sieve works:

### **Step 1: Initialize a List**
Create a boolean list `is_prime` where each index represents whether the number is prime

Fructose is a type of sugar that is often found in fruits and can also be added to foods as a sweetener. It is a simple carbohydrate, specifically a monosaccharide, and is known for its sweet taste. Here are some key points about fructose:

1. **Structure**: Fructose is a six-carbon molecule, like glucose, but it has a different arrangement of functional groups. Its structure allows it to be absorbed efficiently by the body.

2. **Abs

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 2 = 5x - 3 \):

### Step 1: Start with the given equation
\[
3x + 2 = 5x - 3
\]

### Step 2: Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides to get the variable terms on one side
\[
3x + 2 - 3

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to approach solving a problem using the **Equation of a Line**:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- **Given:** Two points on a line, say \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), and a point \( (x, y) \) that lies on the line.
- **Goal:** Find the equation of the
