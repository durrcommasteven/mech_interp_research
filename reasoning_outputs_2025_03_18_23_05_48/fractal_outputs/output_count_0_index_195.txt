Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 10. Alright, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying. It's a linear equation in one variable, x. On the left side, we have 2 times x plus 5, and on the right side, it's equal to 10. My goal is to find the value of x that makes this equation true.

First, I think I should isolate x on

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x + 5 = 10 \). Alright, let me start by understanding what's given here. The equation has two terms on the left side: \( 2x \) and \( 5 \), and the right side is 10. My goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

First, I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x + 3 = 5 \). I remember from school that solving equations usually involves getting the variable by itself on one side. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I need to think it through carefully.

First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: \( 2x + 3 = 5 \). Okay, cool. So,

Alright, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that takes two integers, a and b, and returns their sum. Hmm, that sounds pretty straightforward. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. So I'll probably start with something like `def function_name(a, b):`. Yeah, that makes sense. The function name could be something descriptive, like `sum_numbers` since

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. Hmm, I remember that a rectangular prism has three dimensions: length, width, and height. I think the formula involves multiplying these three measurements together. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

I recall that volume is a measure of space inside a three-dimensional object. For a cube, which is a special type of rectangular prism where all sides are equal, the volume is side length
