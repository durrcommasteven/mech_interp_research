Alright, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm pretty new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I know that a calculator typically has a display screen and buttons for numbers and operations. I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. I think I'll need a div for the calculator, maybe a display input where the numbers will show up, and a grid of buttons inside another div.

Okay

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x + 1} = x + 1 \). Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that when there's a square root on one side of an equation, a common strategy is to square both sides to eliminate the square root. That should make things simpler. So, let me try that.

Starting with the equation:
\[
\sqrt

Alright, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let me start by breaking down what I know about each of these technologies.

First, HTML. I know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's used to structure web pages. So, I'll need to create the basic structure of the calculator, like the display area and buttons for numbers and operations.

Next, CSS. This is for styling, so I want the

Alright, so I have this problem here: "What is 3/4 of 5/6?" Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you want to find a fraction of another fraction, you can multiply the two fractions together. So, in this case, I need to multiply 3/4 by 5/6.

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. If the question was, say, "What is

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this math problem. It says to "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 10." Okay, let me think about this step by step. I remember from class that when you have an equation like this, you need to isolate the variable, which in this case is x. Isolating x means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.

First, let's look
