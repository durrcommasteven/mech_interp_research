Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says, "Prove that the sum of the squares of the roots of the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is equal to \( a^2 - 4b + 4c \)." Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for a polynomial, the roots can be
