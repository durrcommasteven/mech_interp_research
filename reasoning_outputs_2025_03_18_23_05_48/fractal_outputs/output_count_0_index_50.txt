Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hmm, I've heard that HTML is for structure, CSS is for styling, and JavaScript is for functionality. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably start by setting up the basic HTML structure. That means creating a doctype, html, head, and body tags. In the head, I'll include the title and the CSS styles. The body will

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember from school that the area of a rectangle is related to its length and width. But wait, how exactly? Let me think.

Alright, a rectangle has two dimensions: length and width. I think the area is like the space inside the rectangle. So, if I have a rectangle that's, say, 5 units long and 4 units wide, how do I find the area

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x - 6 = 6. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember from school that when you have an equation like this, you need to solve for the variable, which in this case is x. The goal is to get x by itself on one side of the equation.

First, I think I should get rid of the -6 on the left side. How do I do that?

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation 3x² + 5x + 2 = 0. I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the equation is 3x² + 5x + 2 = 0. I know that a quadratic equation is in the form ax² + bx + c

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. I remember that a rectangular prism has three dimensions: length, width, and height. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I think the formula involves multiplying all three dimensions together. So if I have a length of 2 units, a width of 3 units, and a height of 4 units, would the volume just be 2 * 3 *
