In the context of data analysis and machine learning, **Feature Engineering** plays a crucial role in preparing data for modeling. It involves transforming raw data into a form that is more suitable for analysis and algorithms. Here are some common techniques used in Feature Engineering:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Remove Missing Values**: Handle or remove missing data points to ensure data integrity.
   - **Handle Outliers**: Identify and address extreme values that may skew results.
   - **Standardize/

In the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles are linked in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance separating them. This is a fundamental concept in quantum theory, often described as "spooky action at a distance" by Albert Einstein.

### Key Features of Entanglement:
1. **Correlated States**: The particles are always in a correlated state, meaning their properties are linked.

In the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for processing and analyzing data. A neural network is a network of nodes, or neurons, that are interconnected in a way that allows them to learn patterns from data. These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and are used in various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

### Key Components of Neural Networks:

1. **Input Layer**: This is the starting point

In machine learning, a **loss function** is a mathematical expression used to quantify the difference between the predicted output and the actual value. The goal of a loss function is to measure how well a model is performing, with the aim of minimizing this loss. Common loss functions include:

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   - Measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
   - Formula: \( \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of "spooky action at a distance" refers to the instantaneous influence of one particle on another, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon, often associated with the thought experiments of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR paradox), suggests that quantum particles may be inherently interconnected, even when separated by large distances.

### Key Points:
1. **EPR Paradox**: Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen proposed that quantum mechanics
