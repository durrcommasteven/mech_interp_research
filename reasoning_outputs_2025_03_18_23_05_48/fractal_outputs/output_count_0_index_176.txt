Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x + 3y = 7. I remember from class that there are a few methods to solve equations like this, especially when there are two variables. Let me think about what I learned.

First, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's see, if I solve for x, I can subtract 3y from both sides, right? So that would give me

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem where I have to find the value of x that makes the equation 2x + 3 = 5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from school that solving linear equations is a common task, and usually involves isolating the variable, which in this case is x.

Alright, the equation is 2x plus 3 equals 5. So, 2x + 3 =

Alright, the user is asking about the best way to clean a glass table. I should start by considering different methods they might use.

First, I'll think about using regular household items like vinegar and water. That's a common solution because it's effective and easy to find.

Next, I should mention using dish soap since it's another common product people have and works well for breaking down grease.

Then, I'll consider the type of glass. If it's treated glass, like a table

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I remember that the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. But wait, let me think about why that's the case. A rectangle has two dimensions: length and width. If I imagine the rectangle, the length is one side and the width is the other. So if I multiply these two together, I'm essentially covering the rectangle completely with unit squares or unit rectangles, right?

Let me visualize

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 2x² + 3x - 10 = 0. Hmm, okay, quadratic equations. I remember they have something to do with a parabola, and you can find the roots by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because I think that's the easiest if it works.

Looking at the equation 2x² + 3x -
