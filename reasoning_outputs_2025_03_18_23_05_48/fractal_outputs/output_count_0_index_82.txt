Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 \). I remember that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \). Let me make sure I have the coefficients right. Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2^x = 8 \). Hmm, okay. I remember that exponents can be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me think about what this equation is saying. It's saying that 2 raised to the power of x equals 8. So, I need to find the value of x that makes this true.

First, I should probably recall what 8 is as a power

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation \( x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). I remember from school that quadratic equations can have solutions using the quadratic formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think through this carefully.

First, the equation is \( x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). I know that the standard form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation 3 times x minus 2 equals 7. Okay, let's write that down first. It's 3x - 2 = 7. Hmm, I remember from school that when you have an equation like this, you need to solve for x. That means getting x by itself on one side of the equation.

So, the first step is probably to get rid of that -2 on the left side

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this math problem. It says to "Prove or disprove that for all positive integers n, the number of positive integer solutions to the equation x² + y² = n² + 4 is equal to the number of positive integer solutions to x² + y² = n² + 4." Hmm, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I misread it. Let me check again.

Wait, no, it's
