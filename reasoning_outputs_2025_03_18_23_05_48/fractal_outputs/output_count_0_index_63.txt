Fructose, a type of simple sugar, is a monosaccharide that exists in two primary forms: **fructose in solution** and **fructose in food**. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

1. **Fructose in Solution**:
   - **Form**: Fructose, when dissolved in water, exists as a mixture of three different stereoisomers: **α-fructose**, **β-fructose**, and **γ-fructose**.
   - **Structure**:

Fructose, a type of sugar, is a monosaccharide that serves as an energy source in various organisms, including humans. It is particularly abundant in fruits, such as grapes, and is a key component in sweetening foods and beverages. Fructose is also found in honey and is utilized in the body for energy metabolism, especially in muscles and the brain. It is absorbed through the digestive system and plays a significant role in carbohydrate metabolism, contributing to blood sugar regulation.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Fructose is a type of sugar found in fruits, honey, and other natural sources. It is a reducing sugar, meaning it can reduce the oxygen content of air when exposed to it, a property that has been utilized historically for preserving foods. Here are some key points about fructose:

1. **Chemical Structure**: Fructose is a hexose sugar, which means it has six carbon atoms. It exists in a cyclic or open-chain form, with the cyclic form being more stable.

Fructose, a type of sugar, is a monosaccharide with the chemical formula CH₂O. It is distinct from glucose in its structure and metabolic pathways. Here are some key points about fructose:

1. **Structure**: Fructose exists in two primary forms in biological systems: as a linear chain (open-chain) and a ring structure (cyclic form). The open-chain form is the more common and biologically active form.

2. **Metabolism**:
