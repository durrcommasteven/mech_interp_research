Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. It says, "Solve for x in the equation: 3(x - 5) + 4 = 0." Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably get rid of that 3 that's multiplied by the parenthesis. To do that, I can distribute it to both the x and the -5 inside. So, 3 times x is 3x, and

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x² + 2x + 1 = 0. I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me think about which method would work best here.

First, I'll check if this quadratic can be factored easily. The equation is 3x² + 2x + 1 = 0. To factor

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 2 girls in a line, considering that boys don't want to stand next to each other. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, there are 5 children in total: 3 boys and 2 girls. They need to be arranged in a line. The condition is that boys don't want to stand next to each other. So, I need

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x² + 3x - 8 = 0. Hmm, quadratic equations, right? I remember they have something to do with parabolas and finding the roots where the graph crosses the x-axis. But I'm not entirely sure about the steps to solve it. Let me think about what I know.

First off, a quadratic equation is in the form ax² + bx + c =

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x + 4y = 24. Alright, let's start by understanding what the equation is asking. It's a linear equation with two variables, x and y. My goal is to find the values of x and y that make this equation true. But wait, since there are two variables and only one equation, I realize that there are infinitely many solutions. Hmm, that makes sense because without another
