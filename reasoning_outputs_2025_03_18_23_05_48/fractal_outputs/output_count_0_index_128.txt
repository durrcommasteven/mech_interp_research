Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the sum of a series. I remember in school, we learned about arithmetic and geometric series, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach more complex series. Let me start by recalling what I know.

An arithmetic series has a constant difference between consecutive terms, right? Like 2, 4, 6, 8... where each term increases by 2. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using a specific formula

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve for x in the equation 3x² + 4x + 5 = 0. Hmm, okay, quadratic equations. I remember they have something to do with a parabola and finding the roots where the graph crosses the x-axis. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think.

First off, the standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0, right

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I remember that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal, and all angles are right angles. But wait, how exactly does that help me find the area? Hmm, I think area is a measure of space inside a shape, right? So for a rectangle, it's like the space covered by its length and width.

I recall something about multiplying length by width to find the area. Let me think about

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle using its perimeter and one of its sides. I remember that the area of a rectangle is length times width, right? But here, I only have the perimeter and one side. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) is calculated as \( 2 \times (length + width) \).

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the sum of a geometric series. I remember that a geometric series is a series where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio to get the next term. For example, something like 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16... where each term is double the previous one. 

First, I think I should recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series. I remember it's something like S_n = a
