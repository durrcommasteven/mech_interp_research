Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python script that calculates the number of divisors a number has. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it without leaving a remainder. For example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, the function should return 4 for the number 6.

First, I need to decide how

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that can create a list of all possible subsets of a given list. Hmm, I remember that subsets can vary in size from the empty set all the way up to the full list itself. But wait, the empty set is considered a subset of every list, right? So, for example, if I have a list like [1,2,3], the subsets would include everything from [] up to [1,2,

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that determines whether a given number is a prime or not. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Right, so first, I should think about the steps involved in checking if a number is prime.

Let me start by considering the function definition. It should take a single argument, which is the number to check. Let's call it 'n'. So, the

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I remember from school that the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, but I want to make sure I understand why that's the case. Maybe if I break it down, it will make more sense.

Let me visualize a rectangle. It has two pairs of equal sides: the length and the width. If I imagine the rectangle on a grid, maybe that can help. Suppose I have a rectangle

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this question: "How do I determine if my car is totaled?" I'm not really sure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I should look at the car's value. I remember hearing about Kelly Blue Book and Edmunds. Maybe I can check those websites to see how much my car is worth. But wait, I'm not sure if I should just take the trade
