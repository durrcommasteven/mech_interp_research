Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to make a simple calculator using JavaScript. I've never done this before, but I know a bit about programming. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to decide what kind of calculator to make. Since I'm just starting out, maybe a basic one that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. That sounds manageable.

Next, I should consider the structure of the HTML. I'll probably need a display

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the number of moles of HCl gas produced when 2.5 mol of C3H7Cl is reacted with Cl2 in a specific reaction. The reaction given is:

C3H7Cl + Cl2 → 3 HCl + C3H6

Hmm, let me start by understanding the reaction. It seems like C3H7Cl is reacting with Cl2 to produce HCl and C3H6

Alright, the user is asking about the benefits of using a smart home system. I should start by explaining what a smart home system is and how it integrates various devices.

I need to highlight the convenience it brings, like controlling everything from a single app. Maybe mention how it automates daily tasks, such as lighting or temperature adjustments.

Energy efficiency is another key point. I should explain how it helps save energy by optimizing device usage.

Security is important too. I can talk about remote monitoring and

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember from algebra that solving cubic equations can be a bit tricky. They don't always have straightforward solutions like quadratics do. Maybe I should start by trying to see if there are any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. 

The Rational Root Theorem says

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 3 times (x minus 2) equals 12. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step. First, I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to solve for the variable, which in this case is x. 

So, the equation is 3(x - 2) = 12. The first thing I should do is get rid of that 3 that's
