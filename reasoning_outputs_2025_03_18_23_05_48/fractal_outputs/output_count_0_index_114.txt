Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the numbers from 1 to n is less than or equal to 1 divided by the square root of n. Hmm, okay. So, the inequality is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the volume of a sphere. I remember that a sphere is like a perfectly round ball, right? So, maybe it's similar to a circle but in three dimensions. I think the formula for the volume of a sphere involves pi and some radius, but I'm not exactly sure how it all comes together.

Let me start by recalling what I know about volumes. For a circle, the area is πr². But a sphere

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember from school that the area of a shape is basically how much space it takes up. For a rectangle, which is like a four-sided shape with opposite sides equal, I think the formula involves multiplying the length and the width. Let me try to recall.

Wait, is it just length times width? Yeah, that sounds right. So if I have a rectangle that's, say,

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \(3x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0\). Hmm, let me think about the steps I should take. I remember from school that solving quadratic equations usually involves using the quadratic formula. But maybe I should first see if it's factorable. Sometimes factoring can be quicker if the equation factors nicely.

First, let me look at the equation: \(3x^2 + 4x

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a regular polygon. I remember that a regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal, so it's pretty symmetrical. But how do I find the area when I don't know the radius or the apothem off the top of my head?

Wait, I think I remember something about splitting the polygon into triangles. Yeah, if I draw lines from the center to each vertex, the polygon gets divided into congr
