Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to write a simple Python function to calculate the sum of two numbers:

### Step 1: Define the Function
Start by defining a function that takes two parameters. In Python, this is done using the `def` keyword.

```python
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    # Function body will be here
```

### Step 2: Perform the Addition
Inside the function, add the two numbers using the `+

Sure, here's a simple guide to using the **`sort`** function in Python:

### Steps to Sort a List in Python:
1. **Import the `sorted()` Function**:

Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

### 1. **Understand the Problem**
You want to calculate the number of ways to arrange **n** distinct objects into **k** distinct boxes, where each box can hold any number of objects, including zero.

### 2. **Identify the Formula**
The number of ways to distribute **n** distinct objects into **k** distinct boxes is given by the formula:
\[ 
\text{Number of ways} =
