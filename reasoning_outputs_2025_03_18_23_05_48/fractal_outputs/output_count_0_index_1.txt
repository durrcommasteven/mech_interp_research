Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where I need to find the value of a function f(x) at a certain point, but I don't know what the function looks like. The problem just gives me a sequence of points that f(x) passes through. Specifically, it says that f(x) passes through the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,16), (5,

Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that takes a string and returns the number of times each digit appears in that string. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that in Python, functions are usually defined with the `def` keyword. So I'll start by writing a function definition. The function should take a single argument, which will be the input string. Let's call it `s`.

Now, the function needs to

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the square of its coefficients. The equation given is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and the roots are \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). The statement to prove is \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = \frac{b^2 - ac}{a

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 5x + 2 = 13. Alright, let me start by writing down the equation clearly: 5x + 2 = 13. My goal is to find the value of x that makes this equation true. 

First, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. That means I should get rid of the other terms that are attached to it.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 \). Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that quadratic equations are usually solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. This one looks like it might be factorable. Let me try that first.

The equation is \( x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 \). I notice that the coefficients
