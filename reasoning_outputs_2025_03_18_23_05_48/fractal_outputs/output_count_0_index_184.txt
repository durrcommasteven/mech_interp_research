**Answer:**

The term "sustainable development" refers to an approach to economic growth that aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves creating a balance between economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure long-term viability and equity.

### Key Concepts of Sustainable Development:
1. **Environmental Protection**: Ensuring that the environment remains healthy and resilient for future generations.
2. **Economic Growth**: Promoting inclusive growth that

**Answer:**

To solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \), follow these steps:

1. **Subtract 4 from both sides** to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   2x = 6
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for

The term "quantum leap" can refer to two different concepts depending on the context in which it is used:

1. **Physics (Quantum Mechanics):**  
   In quantum mechanics, a quantum leap (or quantum jump) refers to the abrupt transition of a quantum system from one discrete energy state to another. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of quantum theory, where particles such as electrons in an atom can move between energy levels without passing through the intermediate states. These transitions are often accompanied

**Question:** What is the best way to calculate the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space?

**Answer:**

To calculate the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the equations of the lines:**
   - Let the first line be defined by the point \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \) and a direction vector \( \vec{v} = (a,

**Question:** What is the best way to calculate the number of moles of solute in a solution?

**Answer:**

To determine the number of moles of solute in a solution, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Solute and Its Mass:**  
   - Determine the chemical formula of the solute.
   - Calculate the molar mass (molar mass = sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule) of the solute.
