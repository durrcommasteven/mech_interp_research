Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the sum of a series using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

### Step 1: Understand the Series
An infinite geometric series has the form:
\[ S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \dots \]
where:
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( r \) is the common ratio between successive terms.
