Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation 5x² + 3x + 2 = 0. I remember from school that quadratic equations can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because that seems straightforward, but if that doesn't work, I'll move on to the quadratic formula.

First, I need to see if this quadratic trinomial can be factored into two binomials

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the number of possible seating arrangements for 10 people around a circular table with 10 chairs. I remember that with circular permutations, the number of arrangements is different from linear ones because rotations can make some arrangements equivalent. Let me think through this step by step.

First, if everyone was sitting in a straight line, the number of ways to arrange 10 people would just be 10 factorial, which is 10! So that's

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the distance between two points in 3D space using vectors. I remember from my math class that the distance formula in 2D is pretty straightforward, but 3D is a bit more complex. Let me think about this step by step.

First, let's recall the 2D distance formula. If I have two points, say (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between them

Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I remember that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal, and all angles are right angles. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I recall that the area of a shape is generally the space it occupies. For simpler shapes like squares or rectangles, there's a specific formula. I think it involves multiplying the length and the width. Yeah, that sounds right. So,

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 3x + 4 = 5x + 7 \). Okay, let's start by understanding what the equation is saying. It's a linear equation with variables on both sides. My goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

First, I remember that to solve for \( x \), I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. That means I should
