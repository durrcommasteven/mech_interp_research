Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve the equation \(3x^2 + 4 = 5x\). Hmm, okay, let's see. First, I think I should rearrange the equation so that one side is zero. That usually makes it easier to solve for x. So, if I subtract \(5x\) from both sides, it should look like this:

\(3x^2 + 4 - 5x = 0\)

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 \). Hmm, let me start by understanding what kind of equation this is. It looks like a cubic equation because the highest power of x is 3. Cubic equations can have up to three real roots, so maybe I can find all three solutions.

First, I remember that for solving polynomials, one method

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. I remember that a rectangular prism has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me think, is it as simple as multiplying all three together? I think that's right because volume is a three-dimensional measurement. 

Wait, let me double-check. If I have a rectangular box that's 2 units long, 3 units wide, and 4 units high, what's the volume?

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the area of a parallelogram. I remember that a parallelogram is a four-sided shape with opposite sides that are equal and parallel. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think back to my geometry classes.

I recall that for a rectangle, which is a special type of parallelogram, the area is just length multiplied by width. But a parallelogram isn't necessarily a rectangle, so

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says, "Prove or disprove: For all positive integers \( n \), \( (n^2 + 1) \) is a prime number." Hmm, okay. So, I need to check if \( n^2 + 1 \) is prime for every positive integer \( n \).

First, let me understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than
