Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. I remember that a rectangular prism is like a box shape, with six faces, all of which are rectangles. I think the volume is the space inside the box, right? So, how do I find that?

I recall that volume for prisms is generally calculated by multiplying length, width, and height. But wait, let me make sure. I think for a cube, which is a special

Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational. I remember hearing about this in my math class a while back, but I don't recall the exact method. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, what does it mean for a number to be irrational? I think it means that it can't be expressed as a simple fraction, like a ratio of two integers. So, if sqrt(2) were rational,

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this equation: 3x + 4 = 5. Alright, let's break it down step by step. First, I know that this is a linear equation, and I need to solve for x. That means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.

So, the equation is 3x plus 4 equals 5. Hmm, okay. I think the first thing I should do is

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a rectangle. Hmm, okay, I remember from school that the area of a rectangle has something to do with its length and width. Let me think... I believe the formula involves multiplying the length by the width. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I have a rectangle, I just need to know two measurements: how long it is and how wide it is.

Wait, but why is that the case? I

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is: "What is the best way to represent the number 100 in binary?" Hmm, okay. I know binary is a base-2 numeral system, which means it uses digits 0 and 1, and each position represents a power of 2. But I'm not exactly sure how to convert a decimal number like 100 into binary. Maybe I should start by
