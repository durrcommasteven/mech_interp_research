First, I know that square roots can sometimes be tricky because they involve both positive and negative numbers, but since we're talking about the closest integer, I think we can just focus on the positive side because negative numbers would have positive square roots anyway. So, I can probably ignore the negative ones for this question.\n",

But since we're dealing with an integer, I need to find the closest whole number to that square root.\n",

I remember from school that when you have an equation like this, you usually want to get x by itself on one side. So, maybe I should start by subtracting 8 from both sides. That way, I can get rid of that 8 that's being added to 4x. Let me try that.\n",
