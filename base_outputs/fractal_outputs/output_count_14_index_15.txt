 <response>Fractals are patterns that are repeated at smaller and smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. They are found throughout nature and are the result of self-similar patterns that repeat at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. Fractals have been used to model a variety of natural phenomena, including coastlines, river networks, lightning bolts, and plant growth patterns. They have also been used in computer graphics and animation

 <response>Fractals are a series of patterns that are self-similar on all scales. They are often used in computer graphics to create interesting and complex images. For example, the Mandelbrot set is a fractal that can be generated using a simple formula and a few lines of code. </response>

 <response>Fractal trees are self-similar. This means that they are made up of copies of themselves at smaller scales. For example, a tree branch is made up of smaller branches, which are made up of even smaller branches. This self-similarity is what gives fractal trees their intricate and repeating patterns. </response>

 <response>Fractal trees are created using mathematical algorithms that generate complex, repeating patterns. These algorithms are based on the idea of fractals, which are mathematical sets that have

 <response>Fractal geometry is a field of mathematics dealing with the properties of <emphasis>self-similar</emphasis> sets and continuous <emphasis>self-similar</emphasis> <emphasis>scaling</emphasis> processes. Fractals are complex or detailed patterns, 
     at various levels of magnification, that often display self-similarity, 
     or having similar parts on different scales. A simple example of a 
     fractal is a tree; a tree is a complex structure made up
