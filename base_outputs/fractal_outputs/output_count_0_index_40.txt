# Let's start by importing the libraries we will need.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline

# Next, we will import the data set.

## Explanation:

The input is a string and the output is a string. We have to print the input string in the output. The output string is a palindrome of the input string.<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
```
This is a test.
```
