Response:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

Response:  A [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) is an organized collection of data. It is typically contained in multiple [tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)). Like an Excel spreadsheet, each table is composed of rows and columns. And like an Excel spreadsheet, a database can contain multiple tables. Each table is related to other tables, usually through a common field. The relationships between tables are what give a database its power and flexibility.<|end_of_text|>

A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no relationship between two variables. The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is a relationship between two variables. The null hypothesis is usually denoted by H0 and the alternative hypothesis is usually denoted by H1. The null hypothesis is tested by looking at the p-value. The p-value is the probability of getting a result as extreme as the observed result, if the null hypothesis is true
