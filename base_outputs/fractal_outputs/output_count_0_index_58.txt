A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented as an arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction the arrow points represents the direction of the vector. Vectors can be added together by placing the tail of one vector at the head of the other vector, and then drawing a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector. This new vector is the sum
