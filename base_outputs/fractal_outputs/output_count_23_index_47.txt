 <response>Fractal geometry is the study of shapes that are self-similar on all scales, meaning that they are made up of smaller copies of themselves. These shapes are often used to represent complex systems, such as the structure of the universe or the behavior of natural phenomena. Fractal geometry has been applied to a wide range of fields, including physics, biology, and art. </response>

 <response>Fractals are used to model complex phenomena that are
 difficult to describe using traditional mathematical methods. The
 image below is a fractal model of a river system. It was generated

 <response> Fractal images are images that contain self-similar patterns that repeat on different scales.  Fractals are created using fractal geometry, which is a mathematical concept that describes patterns and shapes that are infinitely complex and self-similar.  Fractal images are often used in art and design to create visually appealing and intricate patterns.  They are also used in scientific and engineering fields to model and analyze complex systems and structures.  Fractal images can be created using a variety of techniques, including computer

 <response>Fractal geometry is a type of geometry that involves repeating a pattern of lines, curves, or shapes in a way that creates a self-similar structure. This means that if you zoom in on a part of the pattern, you will see the same pattern repeated over and over again. Fractals are often used to represent natural phenomena, such as the branching patterns of trees or the coastline of a country. They can also be used to create abstract art and design patterns. </response>
