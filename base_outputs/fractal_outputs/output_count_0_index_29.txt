AI:  Friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object. It is the force that resists the motion of an object and is caused by the contact between two surfaces. Friction is an important concept in physics and is used to explain many phenomena, such as the motion of objects, the sliding of objects, and the wear and tear of objects.

# What is the relationship between the number of words in a sentence and the number of words in a paragraph?

The number of words in a paragraph is directly proportional to the number of words in a sentence. This means that if the number of words in a sentence increases, the number of words in a paragraph will also increase.

AI: 1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

2. The AI effect is a phenomenon in which people attribute their lack of understanding of an artificial intelligence system to the fact that the system is artificial, rather than to their own lack of understanding.

3. The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent
