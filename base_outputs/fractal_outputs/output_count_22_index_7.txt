[Answer]:  I'll try to be as concise as possible. First of all, I'd like to define some terms that I'll use in this answer. I'll be using the term "function" to mean a function in the mathematical sense, not a function in the computer science sense. I'll be using the term "number" to mean a number in the mathematical sense, not a number in the computer science sense. I'll be using the term "integer" to mean an integer in the mathematical

[Answer]:  A fractal is a shape that is self-similar. A fractal can be infinitely detailed, no matter how much you zoom in on it. A fractal can be infinitely detailed, no matter how much you zoom in on it.

[Answer]:  Fractals are geometric shapes that can be divided into parts, each of which is a smaller copy of the whole. They can be created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Dropping a pebble into a pond is an example of a fractal process.

This is an example of a fractal. It is a tree that was created by starting with a single line and then drawing smaller and smaller copies of the line.

[Answer]:  Fractal geometry is a very interesting topic and has been studied for centuries. Fractals are geometric shapes that are self-similar at different scales. They are used in many areas of science, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Fractals can be found in nature, such as in the shapes of snowflakes, coastlines, and ferns. They can also be created using computer algorithms.

One of the most famous fractals is the Mandelbrot set,
