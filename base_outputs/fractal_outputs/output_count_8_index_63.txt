 <response>Fractal trees are generated using the L-system algorithm. This algorithm is a simple grammar that generates complex patterns. In this case, the grammar is used to generate a tree. The grammar starts with an initial statement. In this case, the initial statement is F. This is a statement that means draw a line. The next statement is +, which means turn 45 degrees to the right. The next statement is F, which means draw a line. The next statement is +, which means turn

 <response>Fractal is a system for automatically generating web pages from
data, and is designed to be easy to use, even for users who have no
experience with web page design or programming.  Fractal is written in
Python and uses the [Flask][flask] framework.  It is intended to be
extensible, and to be easy to customize to fit your needs.</response>

 <response>Fractal shapes are shapes that are self-similar at different scales. For example, the Koch snowflake is made up of smaller Koch snowflakes, which are made up of smaller Koch snowflakes, and so on. The Sierpinski triangle is another example of a fractal shape.</response>
