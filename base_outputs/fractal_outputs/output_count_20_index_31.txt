 <response>Fractals are self-similar patterns, which means that they are made up of smaller copies of themselves. They are used in many different fields, including mathematics, physics, and biology. Fractals can be created using a variety of methods, including iteration and recursion. Some famous fractals include the Mandelbrot set, the Sierpinski triangle, and the Koch snowflake.</response>

 <response>Fractals are objects that are self-similar.  In other words, they are
the same on every scale.  There are many fractals, but the most famous is
the Mandelbrot set, which is a fractal that is generated by iterating a
simple function, and then plotting the results on a graph.  The graph
looks like a fractal because the pattern repeats on every scale.  For
example, if you zoom in on the Mandelb

 <response>Fractal trees are an example of a fractal. Fractals are never-ending patterns that repeat at different scales. Fractals are often generated by a mathematical equation that is repeated over and over. Fractal trees are a great example of this. They are created by a simple mathematical equation that is repeated over and over, creating a never-ending pattern. Fractal trees are often used in art and design because of their intricate and beautiful patterns.</response>

 <response>Fractal shapes are self-similar and can be subdivided into smaller parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole. Fractal geometry is a field of mathematics focused on fractals. A fractal is a geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term was coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and is derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fract
