Response:  The first step in the process of solving a system of linear equations is to graph the two equations on the same coordinate plane. The point of intersection is the solution to the system of equations. To find the solution, first graph the first equation. To graph the equation, start by plotting the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The y-intercept is (0, 3). Next, plot another point on the line. The second point should be
