Response:  The equation of a line is written in the form: $y=mx+b$ where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.  The slope is the change in the y-value divided by the change in the x-value.  In this case, the y-value is 8 and the x-value is 5.  So, the slope is 8/5.  The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

Response:  The answer is  $f \left(\right. x \left.\right) = \frac{1}{2} x^{2} - 2 x + 3$.

To find the equation of the parabola, we need to find the vertex, focus, directrix, and axis of symmetry.

To find the vertex, we need to find the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

The x-coordinate is given by:

$- \frac{b}{2 a}$

Response:  The following is the solution for the given question:

The equation of the line passing through the point (2,3) and parallel to the line 2x-y+4=0 is

y-3 = 0

y = 3

The equation of the line passing through the point (2,3) and perpendicular to the line 2x-y+4=0 is

y-3 = 0

y = 3

The equation of the line passing through

Response:  I think this is a great question! I think the best way to answer this question is to provide some examples. In my own research, I have used both quantitative and qualitative methods, and I have found that they can be used together to provide a more complete understanding of the phenomenon under investigation. For example, in one study, I used quantitative methods to analyze data from a large-scale survey of students' attitudes towards mathematics. I found that students' attitudes were influenced by a variety of factors,
