[Answer]:  Fractal is a structure which is self-similar at every scale. The simplest example is a line, which can be split into two smaller lines of the same length, which can be split into two smaller lines of the same length, and so on. The fractal dimension of a line is 1. The fractal dimension of a square is 2. The fractal dimension of a cube is 3. The fractal dimension of a sphere is 2.5. The fractal

[Answer]:  Fractals are objects that are self-similar, which means they are the same at every scale. They are often generated by simple recursive rules, such as the Koch snowflake, where every side is replaced by four sides of the same length. This can be continued indefinitely, creating a fractal that is infinitely complex. Fractals are often used in computer graphics to create realistic images, such as landscapes and clouds.

[Comment]:  This is a very basic definition of a fractal,

[Answer]:  A fractal is a never ending pattern. The pattern can be broken down into smaller parts, each of which is a smaller copy of the whole. A fractal is the limit of this process.

Fractals can be generated by iterating a function. For example, the Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the function $z \mapsto z^2 + c$ where $c$ is a complex number. The sequence $z_0, z_1, z_2

[Answer]:  Fractals are self-similar structures. They have the same shape and structure at different scales. The best example of a fractal is a fern leaf. It looks the same at different scales. The fractal dimension of a fractal is the dimension of the fractal. It is a measure of the fractal's complexity. The fractal dimension of a fractal is the dimension of the fractal.
