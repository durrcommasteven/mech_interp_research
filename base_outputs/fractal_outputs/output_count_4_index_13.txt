AI:  Fractals are geometric patterns that are repeated at increasingly smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that may be self-similar across different scales. Fractals are often used in the fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science to model natural phenomena such as coastlines, snowflakes, and river networks. Fractals are also used in art and design to create visually interesting and complex patterns.

Fractals are often characterized by their self-similarity, which means that they have
