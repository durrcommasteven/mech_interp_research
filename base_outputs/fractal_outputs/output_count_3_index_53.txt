Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion of objects that are touching. The frictional force is proportional to the normal force between the objects. When an object is moving, the frictional force is directed opposite to the direction of motion. When an object is at rest, the frictional force is directed opposite to the direction of motion that would be produced by the applied force. Friction is an example of a contact force. Friction is caused by the interlocking of the

Response:  Fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales. They are found in nature and are used in computer graphics to create realistic images. Fractals are created by using a mathematical formula to generate a pattern that is repeated at different scales. The pattern can be a simple shape, such as a line or a circle, or it can be a more complex shape, such as a tree or a mountain. Fractals are often used in computer graphics to create realistic images of natural objects, such as

Response:  Fracture toughness is a material property that is used to describe the ability of a material to resist fracture. It is a measure of the amount of energy required to propagate a crack through a material. Fracture toughness is often expressed in terms of the stress intensity factor, which is a measure of the stress field around a crack. The higher the stress intensity factor, the more difficult it is for a crack to propagate through the material.

Fracture toughness is an important property for materials used in
