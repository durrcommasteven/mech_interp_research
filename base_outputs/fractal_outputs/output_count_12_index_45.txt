AI:  Fractals are a type of geometric pattern that can be generated by a simple mathematical formula. They are characterized by their self-similarity, which means that they contain smaller copies of themselves at different scales. Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena such as coastlines, river networks, and tree branches. They are also used in computer graphics to create realistic textures and in science to study complex systems.<|end_of_text|>

AI:  Fractals are a type of mathematical object that have many self-similar patterns. They can be generated using simple mathematical rules and can be used to create complex and beautiful images. One way to generate a fractal is to use a recursive function, which is a function that calls itself. For example, the Mandelbrot set is generated by a recursive function that iterates over a complex number and checks if it is within a certain boundary. If it is, the function continues to iterate over

AI:  Fractal geometry is the science of irregular, fragmented shapes and patterns. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Fractals are produced by a recurrence of a simple formula or algorithm, and generate the same pattern indefinitely, without repetition. Fractal art is a form of abstract art created

AI:  Fractals are mathematical shapes that are created by repeating a simple pattern over and over again. They are self-similar, which means that they look the same at different scales. Fractals are often used to create complex and beautiful patterns in nature, such as the branching patterns of trees and the structure of snowflakes. They are also used in computer graphics and animation to create realistic and detailed images.
