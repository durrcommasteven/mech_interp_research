Okay, so I need to explain what quantum entanglement is. Hmm, I remember it's something to do with particles being connected, but I'm not entirely sure how. Let me think.

I know that particles like electrons or photons have properties like spin or polarization. Maybe when they're entangled, their states are linked no matter the distance between them. So if one changes, the other does too instantly, even if they're light-years apart. That sounds weird because I thought things couldn

Now, a database is a way to organize this data. But how? Maybe it's like a big box where you put all

Okay, so I need to figure out how to explain the concept of "sustainability" in a simple way. I'm not entirely sure I understand it fully, but I know it's something important for the environment. Let me start by breaking it down.

First, I think sustainability has to do with how we use resources. Maybe it's about not using up the Earth's resources faster than they can be replaced. I remember hearing that we have limited natural resources, so if we don't manage
