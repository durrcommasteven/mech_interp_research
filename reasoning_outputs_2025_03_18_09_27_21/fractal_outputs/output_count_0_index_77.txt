Okay, so I need to understand what "post-independence" means in the context of the United States. I know that the U.S. declared independence from Britain in 1776, but I'm not exactly sure what came after that. Let me think about this step by step.

First, after declaring independence, the U.S. would have to establish a new government. I remember something about the Articles of Confederation being created. I think this document laid the groundwork for the government structure,

Okay, so I need to understand what quantum computing is. I've heard the term before, maybe in the news or something, but I'm not exactly sure what it entails. Let me try to break it down.

First, I know that computers are electronic devices that process data, right? Classical computers use bits, which are like the building blocks of information. Each bit is either 0 or 1, and they work in a binary system. So, if I have a 64-bit

Okay, so I need to understand what a firewall is. I've heard the term before, probably in the context of computer security. From what I remember, a firewall is some kind of security system, but I'm not exactly sure how it works. Maybe it's like a barrier that protects my computer or network from something bad happening.

I think it has something to do with preventing unauthorized access. So, if someone tries to get into my network or my computer, the firewall would stop them.

Alright, so I need to figure out what a "lattice" is. I've heard the term before, especially in math and physics contexts, but I'm not exactly sure what it refers to. Let me start by breaking down the word itself. "Lattice" sounds like it could be related to "lattice points," which I think are points with integer coordinates, like on a grid. But I'm not certain if that's the same thing.

Maybe I should think about different fields

Okay, so I need to understand what a neural network is. From the previous explanation, it seems like it's a complex structure in the brain that processes information. Let me try to break this down.

First, the brain has a lot of neurons, which are like cells that communicate. Each neuron has many connections, called synapses, to other neurons. These connections send signals, which are electrical or chemical, right? When a signal comes into a neuron, it gets passed along to other neurons
