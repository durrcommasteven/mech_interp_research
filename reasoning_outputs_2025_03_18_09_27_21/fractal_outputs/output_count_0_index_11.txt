**Optimization in Deep Learning**: This is a key concept in training and improving neural networks, where the goal is to minimize the loss function by adjusting the model's parameters. This involves techniques like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and their variants like Adam, RMSProp, and Adamax. These methods update the model's weights in the direction that reduces the loss, ensuring the model learns effectively from the training data.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
