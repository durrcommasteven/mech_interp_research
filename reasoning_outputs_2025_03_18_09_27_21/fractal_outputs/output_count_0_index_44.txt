Okay, so I need to understand what a variable is in programming. From the definition given, a variable is like a container that holds a value. That makes sense because I remember in math class, we used variables to represent numbers we didn't know yet. For example, if I didn't know how much money I had, I could say my money is represented by $x. Then, if I found out I had $50, I could substitute $x with 50.

But wait, what exactly are the components of a database? I think there's something called a database management system, or DBMS

Okay, so I need to figure out how to explain the concept of "data lineage" in a simple way. I've heard the term before, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. Let me start by breaking it down.

First, "data lineage" sounds like it has something to do with data and how it's related over time. Maybe it's about tracking where data comes from and how it changes? I think lineage often refers to a family tree or the history of something,
