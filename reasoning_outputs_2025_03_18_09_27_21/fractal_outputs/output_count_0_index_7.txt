The term "quantum computing" refers to a computing model inspired by quantum mechanics, which is fundamentally different from classical computing. Here are some key concepts:

1. **Qubits**: Instead of using bits (binary digits, 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits. A qubit can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, meaning it can represent multiple values simultaneously.

2. **Superposition**: This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics where a q

The term "quantum leap" can refer to two different concepts in physics and popular culture, which can sometimes be conflated. Here's a clear distinction:

1. **Quantum Leap (Physics):**
   - In quantum mechanics, a **quantum leap** (or **quantum jump**) refers to the abrupt transition of a quantum system from one discrete energy state to another. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of quantum theory, where particles such as electrons in an atom can move

The term "quantum leap" in physics refers to the abrupt transition of a quantum system from one discrete energy state to another. This phenomenon occurs when an electron in an atom moves from a lower energy level to a higher one by absorbing energy, typically in the form of a photon. Quantum leaps are essential in processes like electron transitions in atoms and are fundamental to various phenomena, including fluorescence and laser technology. They are also central to quantum mechanical descriptions of atomic structure and spectra.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

The term "quantum computer" refers to a computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use binary systems (bits) to store and process information, quantum computers utilize qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states, allowing for exponentially more computational power.

Key principles of quantum computing include:

1. **Superposition**: A qubit can be in multiple states simultaneously, unlike a classical bit which is either 0 or 1.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**

**Step 1: Understand the Request**
The user is asking for a step-by-step explanation and answer to the question: "What is the probability that a randomly selected chord in a circle will be longer than a given length?" 

**Step 2: Break Down the Problem**
To find the probability, we need to:
1. Define a "random chord" in a circle.
2. Determine the probability that such a chord is
