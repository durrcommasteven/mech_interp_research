A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** is a subset of edges in a graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimal possible total edge weight. This is a fundamental concept in graph theory and has applications in network design, clustering, and optimization problems.

### Key Components:
1. **Graph**: A collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
2. **Weights**: Each edge has a weight, representing its cost or importance.
3. **Objective

A **complex number** is a number in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers, and \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property \( i^2 = -1 \). The complex number can be represented in the complex plane, where the x-axis is the real part and the y-axis is the imaginary part. Key concepts include:

1. **Real Part (a)**: The real component of the

Okay, so I need to understand what "algorithm" means. I've heard the term before, especially in computer science and math. From what I remember, an algorithm is a step-by-step guide to solve a problem. But I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me try to break it down.

First, the word "algorithm" comes from Arabic, right? It means something like "calculation" or "method." So, it's a methodical approach to

A **null pointer dereference** occurs when a program attempts to access an object or function that has not been allocated in memory. This results in a special value called a **null pointer**, which points to no valid memory location. When a null pointer is dereferenced, the program crashes or behaves unpredictably.

### Causes:
1. **Not Initializing Pointers**: A pointer variable is declared but not assigned a valid memory address (e.g., `int* ptr;` without `

A **binary number** is a number that is represented in base 2, which means each digit can be either 0 or 1. Binary numbers are the foundation of how computers and digital devices store and process information. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects of binary numbers:

1. **Base-2 System**: Binary is base-2, which means each place value represents a power of 2. For example, the rightmost digit is \(2^0 = 1\
