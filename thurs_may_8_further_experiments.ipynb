    "1) project residual stream values along the LDA direction \n",

    "1) starting from layer1, can we \n",

    "\n",
    "1) inject the steering vector, or a version which accomplishes the steering, and look at completions \n",

    "2) patch in the heads and look to see whether their effect is the same / similar as the steering vector injection\n",

    "\n",
    "1) expand the initial search for vectors attending to think and stop think, to include those tokens immediately following them \n",
