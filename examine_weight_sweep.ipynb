I remember that a square root is a number that when you multiply it by itself, it gives me back the original number, which in this case is 36. So, if I call the square root of 36 as let's say 'x', then I can write that equation as x times x equals 36. That makes sense because that's the definition I learned in math class.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out what number I can plug into that equation that will make that equation true. So, maybe I should try some numbers and see if they fit. Let me start with smaller numbers because sometimes that's easier. Let's see, if I take 1 and multiply it by itself, that's 1 times 2, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 times 1 is 1, so that's too low because 36 is way bigger than that.\\n\\nOkay, maybe I should try 2 then. So, 2 times 2 is 4. Hmm, still not 36. Maybe 3? Let me check that. 3 times 4 is 12, but that's not the square root. Wait, no, I should be multiplying 3 times 4? No, that's not right. Wait, no, 3 times 3 is 9. So, that\"),\n",

I remember that a square root is a number that when multiplied by itself gives me the original number, which in this case is 36. So, I need to find a number that times itself equals 36.\\n\\nWait, but I also recall that square roots can have both positive and negative answers because if I multiply a positive number by a negative one, I still get a positive result. So, does that mean that both 6 and -6 are square roots of 36? That seems right because 6 times 6 is 36, and -6 times -6 is also 36. So, both of those numbers satisfy the equation.\\n\\nBut then, why do people usually just say 6 when they talk about the square root of 36? Maybe because in math problems, unless specified otherwise, they usually take the positive one. I think that's because in a lot of contexts, like in geometry or algebra, they want the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, maybe that's why people say 6 instead of both 6 and -6.\\n\\nLet me test this out. If I take 6 squared, that's 36, and if I take -6 squared, that's also 36. So, both of them are definitely square roots. But if I think about the graph of a square root function, it\"),\n",

That makes sense.\\n\\nAlright, so I can write that down as an equation: x squared equals 36. So, x² = 36. Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I should probably take the square root of both sides of the equation. That way, I can get x by itself. So, taking the square root of both sides, I get sqrt(x²) equals sqrt(36). \\n\\nWait, but I remember that sqrt(x²) isn't just x, right? Because if x is negative, then sqrt(x²) would still be positive. So, actually, sqrt(x²) is equal to the absolute value of x. That means that x could be positive or negative. So, that gives me two possible solutions. Hmm, okay, so I need to consider both the positive and negative roots here.\\n\\nSo, if I take the square root of 36, that's 6, right?

       "   '<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>What is the square root of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the square root of 36 is. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I remember that a square root is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I call the square root of 36 \"x,\" then I can write that down as x times x equals 36. That makes sense because squaring something means multiplying it by itself.\\n\\nSo, mathematically, that would be x² = 36. Now, to find x, I need to solve this equation. I think the best way to do that is by taking the square root of both sides. If I do that, I get x equals the square root of 36. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative answers because if you multiply a positive number by a negative one, you still get a positive result. So, does that mean that both 6 and -6 are square roots of 36?\\n\\nLet me test that. If I take 6 and multiply it by itself, 6 times 6 is 36. Yep, that works. What about -6? If I do -6 times -6, that should also give me 36 because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, both of those are definitely square roots of 36. But I also recall that sometimes people just give the principal square root, which is the positive'),\n",

Hmm, let me think about what a square root actually means. From what I remember, a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I have √36, I'm looking for a number that times itself equals 36.\\n\\nAlright, let me start by recalling some basic square numbers because 36 seems familiar. I know that 6 times 6 is 36 because 6 squared is 36. So, does that mean the square root of 36 is 6? That seems straightforward, but wait, I also remember something about positive and negative square roots. So, technically, both positive and negative 6 squared would give me 36 as well because (-6) times (-6) is also 36. So, does that mean there are two square roots of 36?\\n\\nBut hold on, when people usually ask for the square root, they might just be looking for the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, in most cases, especially in math problems, unless specified otherwise, the square root of 36 is considered to be 6. I should probably confirm that. Let me think of another example to test my understanding. For instance, the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 times 4 is 16, and also -4 times -4 is 16. But again,\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about this step by maybe a few different ways. Maybe I can start by remembering that square roots are kind of the opposite of calculating something like area or something. Wait, no, that's not really relevant here. Maybe I should think about the number 10.3 itself. So, 10.3 is a little over 10, right? So, if I think about square roots, I know that the square of 4 is 16, but that's way higher than 10. Maybe that's not helpful.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should think about the square of 3. Let me calculate that. 3 squared is 9, right? So, 9 is less than 10.3, so maybe 3 is too low. Then, 4 squared is 16, which is definitely higher than 10.3. So, the square root of 10.3 has to be somewhere between 3 and 4. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.\\n\\nBut wait, 10.3 is pretty close to 10, so maybe the square root is also close to 4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about it more systematically. Maybe I can use some approximation method. I remember something called the Newton method or maybe the linear approximation. Maybe that's too complicated for me right now. Maybe I\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I know that square roots can sometimes be tricky because they involve both positive and negative numbers, but since we're talking about the closest integer, I think we can just focus on the positive side because negative numbers would have positive square roots anyway. So, I can probably ignore the negative ones for this question.\\n\\nAlright, so the square root of 10.3. I remember that square roots are about finding a number that when you multiply it by itself, gives you the original number. So, if I can find a number that when multiplied by itself is around 10.3, that should be the square root. But since we're dealing with an integer, I need to find the closest whole number to that square root.\\n\\nI think the first thing I should do is figure out what the square root of 10 is because that might give me a starting point. I remember that the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 times 3 is 9, and the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 times 4 is 16. So, 10 is somewhere between 3 and 4. Maybe I can get a better estimate for 10.3.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should use some kind of estimation method. I think there's something called linear approximation or maybe just using\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I know that square roots can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with decimals. But maybe I can break it down.\\n\\nAlright, so the question is asking for an integer. That means I don't have to worry about decimals; I just need to find a whole number whose square is as close as possible to 10.3. Hmm, okay. So, maybe I should start by recalling some square numbers because that might help me figure this out.\\n\\nLet me list out some squares of integers. Starting from 0, 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, 5 squared is 25, 6 squared is 36, and so on. Wait, so 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. So, 10.3 is somewhere between 9 and 16. But since 10.3 is less than 16, maybe the closest integer is 3 or 4?\\n\\nBut hold on, 10.3 is closer to 9 or 16? Let me think. 10.3 minus 9 is 1.3, and 16 minus 10.3 is 5.7. So, 10.3 is closer to 9 than\"),\n",

The question is, how many will I have left after that? Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\\n\\nFirst off, I need to figure out what 2/5 of 35 is. I remember that when you want to find out a fraction of something, you can multiply that fraction by the total number of things. So, in this case, 2/5 multiplied by 35 should give me the number of candies I'm going to give away. Let me write that down: 2/5 times 35. Hmm, but wait, 2/5 is a fraction, and 35 is a whole number, so I need to calculate that.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should think about this in another way. Maybe instead of dividing 35 by 5 first and then multiplying by 2? Yeah, that might make it easier. So, 5 times what is going to give me 35? Well, 5 times 7 is 35 because 5 times 10 is 50, which is way more than 35, so maybe 5 times 7 is 35. Yeah, that makes sense because 5 times 6 is 30, and then adding another 5 makes it 35. So, 5 times 7 is 35.\\n\\nOkay, so if\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I remember that when you give away a fraction of something, you subtract that fraction from the total amount. So, maybe I need to calculate 2/5 of 35 and then subtract that from 35 to find out how many are left.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes when I do math problems, especially with fractions, I can get confused. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, 2/5 of 35. To find a fraction of something, I think you multiply the fraction by the number. So, 2/5 times 35. Hmm, but 35 is a pretty big number, so maybe I should simplify the fraction first before multiplying. Yeah, that might make the calculation easier.\\n\\nSo, 2/5 times 35. Let me see, 2 times 35 is 70, and then 5 times what? Wait, no, that's not the right way. Maybe I should divide 35 by 5 first because the denominator is 5. So, 35 divided by 5 is 7.

Hmm, okay, let me think about this. I remember that a square is a type of shape, kind of like a rectangle but with all the sides being the same length. So, if each side is 7 cm, then maybe the perimeter is just adding up all those sides together.\\n\\nWait, but what exactly is a perimeter? I think it's the total distance around the square, right? So, if I imagine the square sitting there, the perimeter would be like the total length that goes around it. So, if each side is 7 cm, then maybe I need to add up all four of them. Hmm, but wait, isn't a square kind of similar to a circle in that way? Like, the circumference is the total distance around a circle, so maybe the perimeter is like that for a square.\\n\\nBut then again, a square is a different shape, so maybe the calculation is a bit different. Let me think. So, if each side is 7 cm, then each one contributes to the perimeter. So, maybe I should just multiply 7 cm by four because there are four sides. Yeah, that makes sense because each side is the same length, so multiplying by four would give me the total perimeter.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes I get confused between area and perimeter. I know that the area is the space inside the square\"),\n",

Hmm, okay, let me think about this. I remember that a square is a type of shape, kind of like a rectangle but with all the sides being equal in length. So, all four sides are the same. That makes sense because if you think about it, a square is pretty symmetrical, right? So, each side is the same as the others.\\n\\nAlright, so the question is about the perimeter. Wait, what's a perimeter again? I think it's the total distance around the shape. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I have a square, I need to figure out how long the total distance around it is. Since all the sides are equal, maybe I can just calculate one side and then multiply it by four? That seems logical because each side contributes to the total perimeter.\\n\\nSo, the square has four sides, each 7 cm long. Let me write that down. So, side length is 7 cm, number of sides is four. So, if I multiply 7 cm by 4, that should give me the perimeter. Let me do that math. 7 times 4 is... hmm, 7 times 4 is 28. So, 28 cm. Is that right? Wait, that seems a bit straightforward, but I think that's correct because each side is contributing equally to the\"),\n",

       "   \"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>If a square has sides of length 7 cm, what is its perimeter?<｜Assistant｜><think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here: If a square has sides of length 7 cm, what is its perimeter? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a square is a type of quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. Since all the sides of a square are equal in length, that should make things a bit easier.\\n\\nAlright, so the question is asking about the perimeter. From what I recall, perimeter is just the total distance around the shape. So, for a square, that would be the sum of all four sides. Since each side is 7 cm, I can probably just multiply that length by four to get the perimeter. Let me write that down to visualize it better.\\n\\nSo, if each side is 7 cm, then four sides would be 4 times 7 cm. Let me calculate that. 4 multiplied by 7 is... hmm, 4 times 7 is 28. So, 28 cm. That seems straightforward, but wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.\\n\\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe breaking it down into individual sides. So, if I imagine the square, each side is 7 cm. So, the first side is 7 cm, the second side is another 7 cm, the third is another 7, and the fourth is also 7. So, adding them all together: 7 + 7 + 7\"),\n",

Let me think about how to solve this. I remember that when you have an equation like this, you usually have to do something called substitution or maybe use some method called substitution method? Wait, no, substitution is when you have two equations and you substitute one into the other. Maybe that's not the case here. Maybe I should just solve it step by step.\\n\\nAlright, so the equation is 4x plus 8 equals 24. I think the first thing I should do is maybe subtract something from both sides to get x by itself. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I subtract 8 from both sides, that should help me get closer to finding x. Let me try that.\\n\\nSo, subtracting 8 from both sides would give me 4x equals 24 minus 8. Hmm, 24 minus 8 is 16, right? So now I have 4x equals 24 minus 8, which is 16. Okay, so now I have 4x equals 24 minus 8, which is 16. So, 4x equals 16. Now, I need to solve for x, so I need to get rid of that 4 that's attached to the x.\\n\\nHow do I do that? Well, I think the way to do that is to\"),\n",

Alright, let me think about how to solve this. I remember from school that when you have an equation like this, you usually want to get x by itself on one side. So, maybe I should start by subtracting 8 from both sides. That way, I can get rid of that 8 that's being added to 4x. Let me try that.\\n\\nSo, if I subtract 8 from both sides, that would look like 4x plus 8 minus 8 equals 24 minus 8. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because I have to do the same thing to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. Okay, so 4x plus 8 minus 8 is just 4x because 8 minus 8 is zero. And on the other side, 24 minus 8 is 16. So now the equation is 4x equals 16.\\n\\nAlright, now I need to get x by itself. Since 4 is multiplied by x, I should probably divide both sides by 4 to undo that multiplication. Let me write that down. So, dividing both sides by 4, that would be 4x over 4 equals 16 over 4. Hmm, 4 divided by 4 is 1, so that leaves me with just x\"),\n",

Hmm, okay, let me think about this. I remember that when something is moving at a certain speed, the distance it covers should be related to that speed over time. So maybe I need to use some kind of formula here.\\n\\nWait, what's the formula for distance again? I think it's something like speed multiplied by time. Yeah, that sounds right. So maybe I can just take 75 kilometers per hour and multiply it by 3.5 hours. That should give me the distance. Let me write that down. So 75 times 3.5. Hmm, okay, but I need to make sure that the units are compatible. Both are in kilometers per hour, so the time is also in hours, so that should be okay.\\n\\nWait, but 3.5 hours is kind of a weird number. Maybe I should convert that into something else to make the multiplication easier. Like maybe into minutes or something. But no, maybe I can just do the multiplication as it is. Let me think. 75 times 3 is 225, right? Because 75 times 3 is 225. Then what about the 0.5 hours? So 75 times 0.5 is 37.5 kilometers. So if I add those two\"),\n",

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to solve this. I remember that when something is moving at a certain speed, the distance it covers is related to that speed and the time it's been moving. I think the formula for that is distance equals speed multiplied by time. Yeah, that sounds right. So, distance equals speed times time, which is written as d = s * t.\\n\\nAlright, so in this case, the speed is 75 kilometers per hour, and the time is 3.5 hours. So, I need to multiply those two numbers together to get the distance. Let me write that down: distance equals 75 km/h multiplied by 3.5 hours. Hmm, okay, but wait, I should make sure that the units are compatible. Both are in hours, so that should be fine. The kilometer part is just part of the speed, so when I multiply them, the kilometers should come out in the distance.\\n\\nWait, but 3.5 hours is a bit tricky because it's not a whole number. I think I can still do the multiplication, but maybe I should convert that 3.5 into something else to make it easier. Or maybe just do the multiplication directly. Let me think. 75 times 3 is 225, right? Because \"),\n",

The equation given is y equals 2x minus 5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have an equation like this, which is probably a linear equation, substituting the value of x into it should give me the value of y. That makes sense because each x has a corresponding y value in these kinds of problems.\\n\\nAlright, so the equation is y equals 2x minus 5. I need to plug in x equals 6 into that equation. Let me write that down so I can see it better. So, substituting x with 6, it should be y equals 2 times 6 minus 5. Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, I need to calculate 2 times 6 first because I think that's the first part of the equation. Let me do that calculation.\\n\\nSo, 2 times 6 is 12. Hmm, that's pretty easy. Now, the equation says I have to subtract 5 from that number. So, subtracting 5 from 12. Let me think about that. If I have 12 and I take away 5, what's left? Well, 5 is like half of 10, so maybe that helps me think about it. But wait, 12 minus 5 is actually 7. Yeah, that makes sense\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have an equation like this, it's called a linear equation, right? It's supposed to represent a straight line on a graph if I plot it. But maybe I don't need to graph it today. Maybe I just need to plug in the value of x into the equation to find y.\\n\\nAlright, so the equation is y equals 2x minus 5. That means that for every value of x, there's a corresponding value of y that I can calculate. So if x is 6, then I should substitute 6 in place of x in that equation. Let me write that down. So, y equals 2 times x minus 5. If x is 6, then y should be 2 times 6 minus 5. Hmm, okay, that seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should make sure I'm doing this right. Sometimes when I'm solving problems, especially math problems, I can get a bit confused if I don't take it step by step. So maybe I should break it down into smaller parts. Let me think about what each part of the equation means. So, y equals 2x minus 5. That means that for each x value, I multiply it by 2\"),\n",

Hmm, I remember that the area of a shape is usually calculated by multiplying something by something else. But wait, which two measurements do I need here? Let me think. A rectangle has two dimensions: length and width. So maybe I need to multiply those two numbers together to get the area.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes people confuse perimeter with area. I should make sure I'm doing the right thing here. Let me recall, perimeter is the total distance around the shape, so that would be adding up the lengths of all the sides. But the question is about the area, which is more like the space inside the rectangle. So yeah, I think multiplying length by width is the right approach.\\n\\nAlright, so the length is 12 cm and the width is 5 cm. Let me write that down: 12 cm times 5 cm. Hmm, what's 12 times 5? I think that's pretty straightforward. Let me count it out. 5 times 10 is 50, and then 5 times 2 is 10, so adding those together would give me 60. So 12 times 5 is 60.

The rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 5 cm. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst off, I remember that the area of a shape is usually calculated by multiplying certain measurements together. For a rectangle, I think it's specifically the length multiplied by the width. Yeah, that sounds right. So, in this case, I should take the length, which is 12 cm, and multiply it by the width, which is 5 cm. That should give me the area.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when I'm trying to remember formulas, I might mix up perimeter with area. I know that the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, so that would be adding up all the sides. But that's not what the question is asking. They want the area, which is the space inside the rectangle. So, yeah, definitely, it's multiplication of length and width.\\n\\nAlright, so let me write that down. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A equals L times W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. So, plugging in the numbers I have, that would be A equals 12 cm times 5 cm.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that percentages can be converted into fractions or maybe even equations. Let me try to write down what I know.\\n\\nFirst off, the problem says that 25% of a number is 42. So, if I let the number be something like x, then 25% of x is 42. So, mathematically, that would be 25% times x equals 42. But wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes because they can be written as percentages or as fractions. Maybe I should convert that percentage into a fraction so that I can maybe use some algebra here.\\n\\nAlright, so 25% is the same as 25 per cent, right? And I know that percentages can be converted into fractions by dividing by 100. So, 25% would be 25 divided by 100. Let me calculate that. 25 divided by 100 is 0.25. So, 0.25 times x equals 42. Hmm, okay, that seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should think about this in terms of equations. So, if 25% of the number is 42, then the number itself must be larger than 42 because 42 is just a part of it. So, maybe I can set up an equation where 42'),\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that percentages can be converted into decimals when dealing with equations, so maybe that's the first step. \\n\\nAlright, 25% is a percentage, right? So, I need to figure out what that is in terms of a decimal because math problems usually use decimals instead of percentages. I think 25% is like a quarter, which is 0.25. Yeah, that sounds right because 100% would be 1, so 25% should be a quarter of that. So, 0.25 times something equals 42. That makes sense.\\n\\nSo, if I let the number be x, then 25% of x is 42. In equation form, that would be 0.25 times x equals 42. So, 0.25x = 42. Now, I need to solve for x. How do I do that? Well, I think I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. So, maybe I can divide both sides by 0.25 to get x by itself. Let me try that.\\n\\nIf I take 42 and divide it by 0.25, that should give me the number.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that percentages can be converted into decimals or fractions, so maybe that's the key here.\\n\\nAlright, 25% is the percentage they're talking about. I know that percentages are just another way of expressing fractions or decimals. So, 25% is the same as 25 per 100, right? Which can also be written as 0.25 in decimal form. So, if I have 25% of something equals 42, that translates to 0.25 times the number equals 42. Hmm, that makes sense.\\n\\nSo, mathematically, I can write that as an equation: 0.25 * x = 42, where x is the number we're trying to find. Now, I need to solve for x. How do I do that? Well, I think I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Since 0.25 is multiplied by x, maybe I can divide both sides by 0.25 to isolate x. Yeah, that sounds right.\\n\\nLet me write that down. If I take 0.25 * x = 42 and divide both sides by 0.25, that should give me x equals 42 divided by 0.25. Okay, so x = 42 / 0\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that percentages can be converted into decimals to make calculations easier. So, 25% is the same as 25 per cent, right? And I think 25% is equal to 0.25 in decimal form. Yeah, that sounds right because 25 divided by 100 is 0.25.\\n\\nAlright, so the problem is saying that 25% of some number is 42. Let me denote that number as 'x' for simplicity. So, 25% of x is 42. In mathematical terms, that would be 0.25 times x equals 42. So, writing that out, it's 0.25x = 42. Now, I need to find the value of x. \\n\\nTo solve for x, I should probably isolate it on one side of the equation. Since 0.25 is multiplied by x, I can do the opposite operation, which is division. So, if I divide both sides of the equation by 0.25, that should give me x by itself. Let me write that down: x = 42 divided by 0.25. \\n\\nHmm, dividing by a decimal can sometimes be tricky, but I remember a little trick where you can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate\"),\n",

I need to figure out what fraction of the cake is left. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the cake is divided into 12 slices. That means each slice is going to be the same size, right? So each slice is 1/12 of the whole cake. That makes sense because if you add up all the slices, they should add up to the whole cake, which is 1. So each slice is 1/12.\\n\\nNow, the problem says that 5 slices are eaten. So, I need to figure out how much of the cake is left after those 5 slices are gone. Hmm, okay. So, if each slice is 1/12, then 5 slices would be 5 times that, right? So, 5 times 1/12. Let me write that down.\\n\\nSo, 5 slices eaten would be 5 * 1/12. Let me calculate that. 5 times 1 is 5, and 5 times 12 is 60. So, 5/12. Hmm, okay, so 5 slices are 5/12 of the cake. So, if I subtract that from the whole cake, which is 1, I should get the fraction that's left.\\n\\nSo, the remaining cake would be\"),\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I think it's a pretty straightforward problem, but I want to make sure I do it right.\\n\\nFirst off, the cake is divided into 12 slices. That means each slice is 1/12 of the whole cake, right? So each slice is pretty small, but I guess that's why they call them slices. Now, the problem says that 5 slices are eaten. So, I need to figure out how much of the cake is left after those 5 slices are gone.\\n\\nAlright, so if each slice is 1/12, then 5 slices would be 5 times that, which is 5/12. So, 5 slices eaten is 5/12 of the cake. But wait, the question is asking what fraction remains. So, I think I need to subtract that 5/12 from the whole cake to find out how much is left.\\n\\nBut hold on, the whole cake is 1, right? So, if I subtract 5/12 from 1, that should give me the remaining fraction. Let me write that down. So, 1 minus 5/12. Hmm, how do I subtract fractions when one of them is a whole number? I remember that to subtract fractions, they need to have the\"),\n",

Let me think about how to calculate that. Okay, the original price is $65, and it's going to be discounted by 30% maybe? Hmm, but wait, sometimes sales can be different types of discounts, like maybe a coupon or something, but I think in this case it's just a percentage discount. So, I think I need to calculate 30% of $65 and then subtract that from the original price. Yeah, that makes sense.\\n\\nAlright, so first, let me figure out what 30% of $65 is. I think I need to use some kind of calculation method here. Maybe I can use percentages or maybe I can use some other method like maybe dividing something. Hmm, wait, percentages are kind of like percentages, so maybe I can just calculate 30% of $65. So, let me think about that.\\n\\nSo, 30% is like 0% maybe, but no, that's not helpful. Maybe I can think of it as 0% is nothing, but 10% is like $5 maybe? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should think about percentages as percentages of money, so maybe I can calculate it as $65 times 30% maybe. Hmm, but I think that's not the way to do it. Maybe I should think about percentages as percentages of dollars, so maybe I\"),\n",

       "   \"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>If a jacket costs $65 and is on sale for 30% off, what is the sale price?<｜Assistant｜><think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here where a jacket is originally $65, and it's being sold for 30% off. I need to figure out what the sale price is. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that when something is on sale with a percentage discount, I need to calculate that percentage of the original price and then subtract it from the original amount. So, in this case, the jacket is $65, and it's 30% off. So, I need to find out what 30% of $65 is and then subtract that from $65 to get the sale price.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes people use different methods for discounts. Like, sometimes they have coupons where you can get a percentage off, but sometimes they have things like store discounts where maybe you can get a dollar amount off instead of a percentage. But in this case, it's definitely a percentage because it says 30% off. So, yeah, I think the way to do it is to calculate the percentage of the original price and subtract that from the total price.\\n\\nSo, let me write that down. The original price is $65, and the discount is 30%. So, the discount amount would be 30% times $65. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, percentages are kind of like fractions, right? So, 30% is like 30 out of 100, which is 0.\"),\n",

That makes sense because if something is 30% off, I'm saving that percentage of the price. So, I should probably start by calculating 30% of $65.\\n\\nWait, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh yeah, percentages are just fractions of 100, so 30% is the same as 30 divided by 100. So, 30 divided by 100 is 0.3. That means 30% is 0.3 times whatever number we're talking about. In this case, it's $65.\\n\\nSo, I think I need to multiply 0.3 by $65 to find out how much discount I'm getting. Let me write that down: 0.3 times 65. Hmm, okay, doing that calculation in my head might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down. 0.3 times 60 is 18, right? Because 0.3 times 10 is 3, so 0.3 times 60\"),\n",

Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by maybe multiple ways to make sure I get it right.\\n\\nFirst off, I think I need to figure out the price per notebook. That makes sense because if I know one notebook is, say, $something, then multiplying that by 10 should give me the total. So, let me try that approach.\\n\\nSo, 7 notebooks are $17.50. Let me divide that amount by the number of notebooks to find out each one costs. Let me write that down: $17.50 divided by 7 notebooks. Hmm, okay, doing that math. Let me see, 17.50 divided by 7. Hmm, I think that's going to be something like maybe $2.5 each? Wait, is that right? Let me check that calculation again because sometimes when I do math in my head, I might make a mistake.\\n\\nSo, 7 times what is 17.50? Let me think, 7 times 2 is 14, and 7 times 3 is 21. So, 17.50 is somewhere between 2 and 3 dollars each notebook. So, maybe 2.5 is the right number because 2 times 7 is 14, and 0.5 times 7 is 3.5\"),\n",

       "   \"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>If 7 notebooks cost $17.50, how much do 10 notebooks cost?<｜Assistant｜><think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here: If 7 notebooks cost $17.50, how much do 10 notebooks cost? Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I think I need to figure out the price per notebook first, and then multiply that by 10 to find the total cost. Yeah, that makes sense because if I know the price of one notebook, then I can just scale it up for 10.\\n\\nAlright, so first step, find the price per notebook. The total cost is $17.50 for 7 notebooks. So, I guess I need to divide that total amount by the number of notebooks. Let me write that down: $17.50 divided by 7 notebooks. Hmm, doing that division might be a bit tricky because 17.50 isn't a whole number, but I think I can handle it.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should think about it in cents to make the division easier. So, $17.50 is the same as 1750 cents. Yeah, that might help because then I can divide 1750 cents by 7 notebooks. Let me try that. So, 1750 divided by 7. Hmm, okay, 7 times 250 is 1750 because 7 times 200 is 1400, and 7 times 50 is 350, so 1400 plus 350 is 1750. So, 7 times 250 is 175\"),\n",

The ratio is 5 to 3, and the total number of people is 40. I need to figure out how many children are there. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that ratios can be kind of like fractions sometimes. So, if the ratio of adults to children is 5:3, that means for every 5 adults, there are 3 children. Maybe I can think of it as a group of 5 adults and 3 kids going to the party together. That makes sense because the total number of people is 5 plus 3, which is 8 people in that group. Hmm, wait, but the total number of people at the party is 40, not 8. So maybe I need to scale up that ratio to fit 40 people.\\n\\nSo, if one group is 5 adults and 3 children, that's 8 people. But we need to have 40 people instead of 8. So maybe I can multiply that ratio by some number to get up to 40. Let me think about how to do that. Maybe I can divide 40 by 8 and see what multiplier I need. So, 40 divided by 8 is 5. Hmm, okay, so if I multiply the ratio by 5, that should give me the number of adults and children\"),\n",

I need to figure out how many children are there. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.\\n\\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There's a party with both adults and children, and the number of adults compared to the number of children is 5 to 3. So, for every 5 adults, there are 3 children. That makes sense. And the total number of people at the party is 40. So, if I can figure out how many groups of 5 adults and 3 children make up 40 people, I can find the number of children.\\n\\nAlright, so ratios are about comparing quantities, right? So, in this case, the ratio is 5:3 for adults to children. That means if I have 5 adults, I have 3 children. But since the total number is 40, I need to find out how many times this ratio repeats or scales up to 40 people.\\n\\nI remember that ratios can be scaled up by multiplying by a common factor. So, maybe I can think of this as 5 parts for adults and 3 parts for children. Each part would then represent a certain number of people.

I need to figure out how many children are there. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.\\n\\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There's a party with both adults and children, and the number of adults to children is in the ratio of 5 to 3. So for every 5 adults, there are 3 children. And altogether, the number of people is 40. So, I need to find out how many kids are there.\\n\\nAlright, so ratios usually involve some kind of comparison between two things. In this case, it's comparing the number of adults to the number of children. So, if I think of the ratio as 5:3, that means for every 5 adults, there are 3 children. But how does that translate into actual numbers when the total is 40?\\n\\nI remember that ratios can be used to set up equations. So maybe I can let the number of adults be 5 times some number and the number of children be 3 times that same number. That way, the ratio is maintained. Let me write that down.\\n\\nLet’s say the number of adults is 5x and the number of children is 3x. Then, the total number of people would be adults plus children, which\"),\n",

I need to figure out how many children there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There's a party with adults and children, and the number of adults to children is in the ratio of 5 to 3. The total number of people at the party is 40. So, I need to find out how many kids are there. Got it.\\n\\nAlright, so ratios. Ratios compare quantities. In this case, the ratio of adults to children is 5:3. That means for every 5 adults, there are 3 children. So, if I imagine a group where there are 5 adults and 3 children, that's a total of 8 people. But in reality, the total number is 40, which is much bigger. So, I think I need to scale up this ratio to match the total number of people.\\n\\nLet me write this down. Let's denote the number of adults as 5x and the number of children as 3x. The reason I'm using x is because ratios are about proportionality, so multiplying both parts by the same number should keep the ratio intact. So, if adults are 5x and children are 3x\"),\n",

I remember that a square root is a number that when you multiply it by itself, it gives me back the original number, which in this case is 36. So, if I call the square root of 36 as let's say 'x', then I can write that equation as x times x equals 36. That makes sense because that's the definition I learned in math class.\n",

      "Now, I need to find out what number I can plug into that equation that will make that equation true. So, maybe I should try some numbers and see if they fit. Let me start with smaller numbers because sometimes that's easier. Let's see, if I take 1 and multiply it by itself, that's 1 times 2, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 times 1 is 1, so that's too low because 36 is way bigger than that.\n",

So, does that mean that both 6 and -6 are square roots of 36? That seems right because 6 times 6 is 36, and -6 times -6 is also 36. So, both of those numbers satisfy the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, why do people usually just say 6 when they talk about the square root of 36? Maybe because in math problems, unless specified otherwise, they usually take the positive one. I think that's because in a lot of contexts, like in geometry or algebra, they want the principal square root, which is the positive one.

To do that, I should probably take the square root of both sides of the equation. That way, I can get x by itself. So, taking the square root of both sides, I get sqrt(x²) equals sqrt(36). \n",

      "So, if I subtract 8 from both sides, that would look like 4x plus 8 minus 8 equals 24 minus 8. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because I have to do the same thing to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. Okay, so 4x plus 8 minus 8 is just 4x because 8 minus 8 is zero. And on the other side, 24 minus 8 is 16. So now the equation is 4x equals 16.\n",

      "Alright, now I need to get x by itself. Since 4 is multiplied by x, I should probably divide both sides by 4 to undo that multiplication. Let me write that down.
