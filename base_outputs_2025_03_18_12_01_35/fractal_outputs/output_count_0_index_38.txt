Explanation:

There are three different ways of writing a number in binary, but only one of them is correct. The other two are wrong.

The first way of writing the number 5 in binary is:

001010

The third way of writing the number 5 in binary is:

010101

The first way of writing the number 5 in binary is wrong because the first digit is a 0.
