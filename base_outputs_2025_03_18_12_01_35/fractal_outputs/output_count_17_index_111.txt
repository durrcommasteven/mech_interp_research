 <response>Fractal is a fractal generator that uses a simple equation to generate a fractal. It uses the equation $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ to generate a fractal. The fractal is generated by iterating the equation for a given number of iterations. The number of iterations is determined by the user. The fractal is then displayed on the screen.</response>

 <response>Fractal structures are self-similar, meaning that a fractal structure has the same shape at all scales. This means that a fractal structure can be zoomed in on infinitely, and still retain the same shape. Fractal structures are often found in nature, such as the branches of a tree or the veins in a leaf. Fractals are also used in mathematics and computer science to create complex and detailed images.</response>

 <response>Fractals are a class of shapes that have self-similarity. This means that they are the same at every scale. For example, a fern leaf is a fractal. If you look at the leaf at a certain scale, it looks like a fern leaf. If you look at the leaf at a smaller scale, it still looks like a fern leaf. If you look at the leaf at an even smaller scale, it still looks like a fern leaf. This self-similarity is
