 <response>Fractal trees are a good example of fractals. Fractals are objects that are self-similar, meaning that they have the same pattern on every scale. The trees are generated by recursively adding branches to a trunk. Each branch is generated by taking the previous branch and adding a new branch to it. The process is repeated until the desired level of detail is reached. The result is a tree that looks like it was generated by a computer, but it's actually a mathematical object that can be

 <response>Fractals are images which can be made from a set of rules that are repeated infinitely. They are created by mathematical formulas and are self-similar. This means that they look the same at any scale, from very small to very large. They are also infinite and never ending. They can be used to describe the structure of many things in nature, such as snowflakes, coastlines, and mountain ranges. They can also be used to create beautiful and intricate designs. Fractals have

 <response>Fractal, fractal, fractal.  Fractal is a word that describes a pattern that repeats itself.  If you look at a tree, you can see branches that branch and branch again.  If you look at a tree trunk, you can see rings that are like branches branching.  If you look at a leaf, you can see veins that are like branches branching.  If you look at a rock, you can see layers that are like rings.  If you look at
