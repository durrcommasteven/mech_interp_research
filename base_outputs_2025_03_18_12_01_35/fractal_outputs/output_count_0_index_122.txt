A program is a sequence of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a task. The instructions are executed one after the other. Computers do not really understand instructions, so they need to be given exact, step-by-step instructions, otherwise known as algorithms. An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined steps that specifies how to solve a problem. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.<|end_of_text|>
