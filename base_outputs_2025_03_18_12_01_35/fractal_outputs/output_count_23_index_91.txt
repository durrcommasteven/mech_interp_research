# Answer
 A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

# Answer
A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. An example of a non-exact fractal is the coastline of Britain, which has the same statistical properties no matter what scale you choose. This property is called self-affinity.<|end_of_text|>

# Answer
Fractals are shapes that have the same pattern repeated over and over. Fractals are useful in creating realistic images and in understanding how shapes work. A fractal is a self-similar object embedded in a space of a different dimension, and whose self-similarity is described by a recursive pattern. Fractals are encountered in many fields, such as chemistry, physics, and engineering. Fractals also make an appearance in the arts, for example in musical composition. Fractals
