 <response>Fractal structures are found in nature and are often associated with
  self-similarity.  In other words, a fractal can be broken down into smaller
  parts that are similar to the whole.  Fractals are often used in the
  visualization of data, such as the distribution of galaxies in the universe.
  Fractals are also used in the study of chaos, as they are often used to
  represent complex systems that are difficult to model.</response>

 <response>Fractal dimensions are the dimensions of fractals, a type of mathematical object that are self-similar, which is a pattern where the same structure is repeated at every scale. The fractal dimensions of a fractal object are the dimensions of the fractal. Fractal dimensions are not the same as the dimension of a space in which the fractal is embedded, such as the dimension of the Euclidean plane (2) or the dimension of a Euclidean space (3). Fractal dimensions are

 <response>Fractals are geometric figures that are self-similar, which means that they have a repeating pattern. A fractal is a geometric object that is part of itself, so that it can be divided into parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole. The fractal dimension is a measure of how completely a fractal fills space. A fractal dimension is greater than the topological dimension of the space in which the fractal is contained. Fractals are often used to

 <response>Fractal geometry is the geometry of fractals (from the Latin fractus = "broken"), which are self-similar structures displaying detailed similarity at arbitrarily small scales.</response>
