 <response>Fractal geometry is a geometry of natural forms, where the whole is contained in the parts, and the parts are contained in the whole. Fractal geometry is the study of self-similar sets and of their properties. This means that the properties of a fractal are the same at all scales, and the fractal is made up of parts that are similar to the whole. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal that is made up of many smaller Mandelbrot sets. The

 <response>Fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales. They are often used in computer graphics and in the design of algorithms. For example, the Koch snowflake is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly adding smaller and smaller triangles to a line segment. The Mandelbrot set is a famous example of a fractal that is generated by repeatedly adding smaller and smaller circles to a point. The Julia set is another example of a fractal that is generated by repeatedly adding smaller and smaller squares to

 <response>Fractal is a form of art that is created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. In the case of fractals in nature, the form is repeated in a way that displays an iterative structure with similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales. This is called self-similarity, or the property that a pattern is repeated at every scale. Self-similarity is the reason fractals look the same at different levels of magnification. Fractals are found in nature in

 <response>Fractals are patterns that repeat themselves over and over again on smaller and smaller scales. The patterns are not always symmetrical. Fractals are found in nature and can be used to model natural phenomena such as coastlines and clouds. They can also be used to create art and music. Fractals are a way of representing infinity in a finite space.</response>

 <response>Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of fractals. Fractals are self-similar structures that can be generated by repeated application of a simple rule. Fractal geometry has many applications in the natural world, such as in the growth of plants and animals, and in the formation of clouds and coastlines.</response>
