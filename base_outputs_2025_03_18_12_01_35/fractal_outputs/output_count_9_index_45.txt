AI:  Fractals are a type of mathematical object that are formed by repeated iteration of a simple process. They are characterized by their self-similarity, which means that they have the same pattern at every scale. Fractals can be found in many different forms, such as in nature, in art, and in mathematics. They have been studied by mathematicians for centuries, and have been used in a variety of fields, including physics, biology, and computer science.

AI:  Fractals are a mathematical concept that involves the repetition of a pattern at increasingly smaller scales. This results in a self-similar structure that can be observed at different levels of magnification. Fractals have been used in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and mathematics, and have been a source of inspiration for artists and designers.

Fractals can be created using a variety of methods, such as the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, and the Sierpinski

AI:  Fractals are a class of infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. 

Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena that exhibit self-similarity, such as coastlines, mountain ranges, and river networks. They can also be used to create beautiful and intricate designs, such as the Mandelbrot set.

One of the most famous fractals is the Mandelbrot
