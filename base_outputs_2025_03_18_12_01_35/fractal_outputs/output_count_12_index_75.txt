# Answer
A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger sponge, which is made from a solid cube whose center is hollow. This center is then replaced with multiple smaller cubes. Each one of those cubes in turn is replaced with smaller cubes, and so

# Answer
A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole, a property called self-similarity. The term was coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".

Fractals are encountered in many fields, including chaos theory, logic, ecology, and computer science, and form an

# Answer
 A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the whole. Fractals are generally self-similar (parts of the whole resemble the whole in some way), and independent of scale (they show detail at every scale). Many mathematical structures are fractals; e.g. Sierpinski triangle, Koch snowflake, Lorenz attractor, Mandelbrot set, Cantor set

A fractal is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in the magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that
