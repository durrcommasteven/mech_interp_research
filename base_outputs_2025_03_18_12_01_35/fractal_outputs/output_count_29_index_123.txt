# Answer
A fractal is a geometric pattern that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. Fractals are used to describe and simulate many natural objects that exhibit irregular patterns such as lightning, rivers, vegetation, seashores, mountain ranges, and animal skulls.<|end_of_text|>

# Answer
A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term was coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".

Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to a "fading memory" of processes that created them, for example, the shape of mountains

# Answer
Fractal is an object which has a self-similarity property. Fractal is a part of the object which is similar to the whole object. Fractal has infinite number of details. Fractal can be generated by using the iteration process. Fractal can be generated by using the iterative process. Fractal can be generated by using the iterative process.

A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar and has a fractal dimension. A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar and has a fractal dimension. A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar and has a fractal dimension. A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar and has a fractal dimension.

# Answer
A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers. Fractals are typically self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are "the same from near as from far". Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale, or they may be nearly the same at different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self-similarity per se to exclude trivial self-similarity and include the idea
