1. The probability that the ball is red is 1/4. There are two balls, so the probability that the first ball is red is 1/4 and the probability that the second ball is red is 1/4. The probability that both balls are red is 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16. The probability that at least one of the balls is red is 1/16 + 1/

[Answer]:  Fractals are a type of mathematical object that are self-similar across different scales.  This means that if you zoom in on a fractal, the same pattern will continue to repeat.  This property makes fractals both beautiful and useful for modeling complex systems in nature.

One example of a fractal is the Mandelbrot set, which is a set of complex numbers that are generated by iterating a simple equation.  The Mandelbrot set has been studied

[Answer]: 1. What is the difference between a sequence and a series? 2. What is the difference between a convergent sequence and a divergent sequence? 3. What is the difference between a convergent series and a divergent series? 4. What is the difference between a convergent geometric series and a divergent geometric series? 5. What is the difference between a convergent p-series and a divergent p-series? 6. What is the difference between a convergent

[Answer]:  A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term was coined by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".

Fractals are generally self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are "the same from near as from far". Fractals may be

[Answer]:  I will be answering this question from a mathematical perspective. But before I do that, I would like to make it clear that I am not a mathematician, but I do have a deep appreciation for the subject and its beauty.

First, let’s define what a function is. A function is a mathematical object that takes one or more inputs and produces one or more outputs. In other words, a function is a rule that tells us how to get from one set of values to another. For
