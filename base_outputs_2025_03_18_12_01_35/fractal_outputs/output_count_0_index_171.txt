# Answer
A **database** is a structured collection of data stored in a computer system. It is typically organized into tables, which are collections of related data. The data in a database is usually stored in a format that allows it to be easily retrieved and manipulated. A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that allows users to create, maintain, and query databases. A DBMS provides a way to organize, store, and retrieve data in a way that is efficient and easy to use.

<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
# The first step is to import the necessary libraries, including the NumPy library for working with arrays and matrices, and the matplotlib library for plotting graphs. We also define a function to calculate the dot product of two vectors.
# Next, we create a random matrix with shape (10, 3) and a random vector with shape (3, 1). We then use the dot product function to calculate the dot product of the matrix and vector.
# Finally, we plot the result of the
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
# 1. The main purpose of the function is to take a string as an argument and return the string in reverse order. 
# 2. The function is implemented using a recursive approach, where the function calls itself with the substring from the end of the original string to the beginning. 
# 3. The function returns the reversed string when the substring is empty. 
# 4. The function is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the string once, and it does not
