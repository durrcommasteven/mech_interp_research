[Answer]:  Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.

[Answer]:  Fractals are a special class of geometrical objects that have a self-similar structure. They are created by a recursive algorithm that generates a shape by repeating the same pattern at different scales. The most famous fractal is the Mandelbrot set, which is a collection of points in the complex plane that are generated by iterating a simple formula. Fractals are often used in computer graphics and in the study of chaos theory, as they can be used to model complex and unpredictable systems.

[Answer]: 1. A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term was coined by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".
