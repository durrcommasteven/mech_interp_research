Assistant:  Hi, I'm Assistant, your AI tutor. I can help you with your math homework. What's your question?

Student:  How do I find the solution to a system of linear equations using the substitution method?

Assistant:  Great question! The substitution method is a way to solve a system of linear equations by substituting one equation into the other. Here's an example:

Example: Solve the system of linear equations using the substitution method.

x + y = 5

Assistant:  I have been asked to come up with a way to measure the distance between two points on a sphere.  I came up with the following equation:  $\theta$ = $\arccos(\frac{a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2}}{2ab})$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the two points on the sphere, and a, b, and c are the distances between the two points and the center of
