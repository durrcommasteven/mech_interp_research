# Answer
The answer is simple, if we know the answer we can solve the problem. But if we don't know the answer, we can't solve the problem. So, we have to know the answer first.<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
The answer is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the function to be integrated
def f(x):
    return np.sin(x)

# Define the interval of integration
a, b = 0, 2*np.pi

# Define the number of subintervals
n = 10

# Define the step size
h = (b - a) / n

# Initialize the sum
sum = 0

# Loop over
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
The answer is that the two statements are equivalent, because the statement
$\forall x \exists y \, P(x, y)$
is equivalent to
$\exists y \forall x \, P(x, y)$
by the commutativity of conjunction.<|end_of_text|>
