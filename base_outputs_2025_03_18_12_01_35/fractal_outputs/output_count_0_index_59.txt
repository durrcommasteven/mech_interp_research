# Answer
# A Python dictionary is a collection of items, where each item is a key-value pair. The key is used to access the value. Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed after they are created.

# For example, you can create a dictionary like this:

# my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

# To access the value associated with a key, you can use the following syntax:

# print(my_dict['key1

# Answer
# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

# The return statement is used in a function to return the result and terminate the function.

# The return statement is optional in a function. If omitted, the function will return None to the caller.

# A function definition is executed before calling the function, so that the code executes sequentially, creating an execution context

# Answer
A computer program is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task. A program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do and how to do it. The instructions in a program are written in a programming language that the computer can understand.

A program can be as simple as a single line of code that tells the computer to print a message on the screen, or it can be as complex as a large software application that performs a wide range of tasks
