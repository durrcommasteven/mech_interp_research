 <response>Fractal image is a picture that is made of a repeating pattern. 
 The pattern is made up of smaller versions of itself. 
 Fractals are used in mathematics and science to study complex systems. 
 Fractals are also used in art and design to create interesting and complex patterns.</response>

 <response>Fractal art is a type of digital art that uses fractals to create images. 
 Fractals are mathematical equations that describe complex patterns. 
 Fractal art is created by

 <response>Fractal geometry is a very interesting subject that has been studied by mathematicians for many years. The fractal geometry is used to describe and measure the complexity of various natural objects. A fractal is a geometric object that is self-similar in the sense that it looks the same at different scales. It has the property that its detailed structure is similar to its overall structure. Fractals are characterized by a non-integer dimension and they are used to describe and measure the complexity of various natural objects

 <response>Fractal is a tool for exploring and visualizing the Mandelbrot set. It has been designed to be easy to use and yet powerful enough for advanced users. It is a cross-platform application written in C++ and using Qt 4.6.0 as a GUI toolkit. It uses OpenGL for rendering and is designed to work on any platform that supports both Qt and OpenGL.</response>
