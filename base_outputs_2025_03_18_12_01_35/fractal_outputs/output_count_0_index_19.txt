The number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects is given by the binomial coefficient, $\binom{n}{k}$, which is defined as $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. The binomial coefficient can be computed using the following formula:

$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

where $n!$ is the factorial of n.

## Definition:

A function is a relation that maps every element from a set (domain) to a single element in another set (range). The function is said to be one-to-one if every element in the range is mapped to by only one element in the domain.

## One-to-one Function:

A function is said to be one-to-one if every element in the range is mapped to by only one element in the domain.

## Example:

Let f: Aâ†’B

## 1. What is a random variable?

A random variable is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance or probability.

## 2. What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables?

A discrete random variable is a variable that can take on only a countable number of values, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. A continuous random variable is a variable that can take on any value within

Q: In the figure below, two blocks are connected by a massless rope that passes over a massless pulley. The coefficient of kinetic friction between block A and the surface is 0.25. If block A is pulled to the right at a constant velocity, what is the magnitude of the force F?

A: The answer is 100 N. The friction force is 0.25mg = 0.25*5 = 1.25 N. The
