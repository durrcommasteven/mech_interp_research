# Introduction

The main objective of this project is to use the concept of reinforcement learning to solve the classic cart-pole balancing problem. This project will be implemented using the Python library OpenAI Gym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The cart-pole balancing problem is a classic control problem in which a pole is attached to a cart and the goal is to balance the pole upright by applying forces to the cart. This project will use a deep Q-network
