Response:  A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. As you already know, functions are important to MVC because a controller contains several functions that are executed according to the URL. 

Response:  A class is a template for creating objects. Each class can contain multiple methods and variables. A class can

Response:  Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with patterns that are repeated at increasingly smaller scales. Fractals are characterized by self-similarity, which means that they look similar at different scales. Fractals are often used to describe natural phenomena that are too complex to be described by traditional mathematical models.

# What is a polynomial?

A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate x is x2 − 4x + 7. An example in three variables is x3 + 2xyz2 − yz + 1.

Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For

A graph is a collection of vertices and edges. A graph can be directed or undirected, and a graph can be weighted or unweighted. In a directed graph, edges have a direction associated with them, and in an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction associated with them. In a weighted graph, edges have a numerical value associated with them, and in an unweighted graph, edges do not have a numerical value associated with them.

Response:  A good definition of a fractal is that it is a shape that is self-similar across all scales. A simple example of this is a line, which can be divided into infinitely smaller lines, each of which is the same as the original line. This is the simplest example of a fractal, but there are many others, such as the Sierpinski triangle and the Koch snowflake. Fractals are often used in computer graphics to create realistic images, and they are also used
