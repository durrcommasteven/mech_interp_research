Assistant:  Fractals are mathematical objects that are self-similar across different scales. They are generated by a repeating pattern that is applied recursively, resulting in a never-ending and infinitely complex structure. Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena such as coastlines, river networks, and lightning bolts, as well as to create visual art and design. Some common types of fractals include the Mandelbrot set, the Koch snowflake, and the Sierpinski triangle. Fractals can

Assistant:  Friction is the resistance that a surface offers to the movement of an object sliding across it. The amount of friction depends on the nature of the two surfaces in contact. The rougher the surface, the more friction there is. The smoother the surface, the less friction there is.

Assistant:  Fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit a pattern at every scale. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fract
