Assistant:  Fractals are a class of infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes

Assistant:  Fractals are mathematical shapes that can be created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. They are self-similar, which means that they look the same at any scale. This makes them very useful for modeling complex systems, such as the weather or the stock market. They are also beautiful, and can be used to create stunning visual art.

Fractals have a long history, dating back to the work of mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot and

Assistant:  Fractals are mathematical objects that are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are characterized by self-similarity, which means that they look similar at different levels of magnification. This property gives fractals a distinctive, often intricate and irregular appearance. Fractals have applications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science.

Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena that exhibit complex and irregular patterns, such as
