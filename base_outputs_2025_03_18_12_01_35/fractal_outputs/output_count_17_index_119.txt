[Answer]:  Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.

[Answer]: 1. A fractal is a geometric shape that repeats itself at different scales. Fractals are often used to model irregular shapes in nature, such as coastlines, mountains, and clouds. 2. Fractals can be created using a variety of methods, including iteration, recursion, and self-similarity. 3. Fractals can be used to create complex and detailed images, and they can be used to model a wide range of natural phenomena. 4. Fract

[Answer]:  A fractal is a geometric shape that can be divided into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. A fractal is also "a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole," a property called self-similarity. The term was coined by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning

[Answer]:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos.

A fractal is a never ending pattern that repeats itself at different scales. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal that is generated by iterating a function with complex numbers. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that remain bounded under iteration of the function f(z) = z^2 + c, where c is a complex number. The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating this function for each complex number c in the complex plane. The Mand
