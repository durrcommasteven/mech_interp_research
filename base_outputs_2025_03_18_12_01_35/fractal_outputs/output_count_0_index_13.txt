## Question

The following questions are from the 2008 AP Calculus BC exam. 1. Suppose that f is a function defined on the closed interval [a,b] such that f is continuous on (a,b), but not necessarily continuous at a and b. Which of the following statements must be true? (A) If f is differentiable on (a,b), then f is differentiable at a and b. (B) If f is differentiable on

AI: Â The ability to understand and interact with the world around us is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. It involves a range of cognitive abilities, including perception, attention, memory, language, and reasoning. In order to develop such abilities, we need to be able to process and interpret the information that we receive from our senses. This requires the ability to extract meaningful patterns and relationships from the data that we receive, and to use these patterns to make predictions and decisions.

One way to develop these abilities is
