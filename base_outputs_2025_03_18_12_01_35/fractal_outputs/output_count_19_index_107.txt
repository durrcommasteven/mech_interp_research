# Answer
A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the whole. Fractals are generally self-similar (at least approximately or abstractly), and display similar patterns at increasingly small scales. Many fractals are (formally) infinite in detail throughout their (mathematical) extent. 
Fractals are of great scientific interest because they are found in many natural and man-made phenomena.

# Answer
A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. Fractals are encountered in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, information theory, geology, computer science, cosmology, linguistics and music. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory because they show up in many chaotic systems. Natural objects that approximate fractals to a degree include clouds

# Answer
 A fractal is a shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between integers. It is also used as a term for a family of curves, shapes, or sets that display self-similarity, detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their

# Answer
A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar. This means that it looks the same at any scale. For example, a snowflake is a fractal. It has the same shape at any scale, whether it is large or small. Fractals are used in many fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science. They are also used in art and design.

# Answer
Fractal geometry is a mathematical subject that is based on the idea that there are many geometrical structures that are self-similar, meaning that they are similar to themselves at different scales. In other words, when we look at a fractal, we can see the same patterns repeated over and over again, at different sizes and scales. This is in contrast to traditional Euclidean geometry, which is based on the idea of a smooth, continuous curve that can be described by a set of rules. Fr
