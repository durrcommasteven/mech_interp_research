AI:  Fractal geometry is a field of mathematics focused on the study of fractals. A fractal is a geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity, which means that it can be divided into parts, each of which is similar to the whole. Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena, such as coastlines, mountains, and clouds. Fractal geometry is a relatively new field of mathematics, and it is still being developed and explored.

Fractal geometry has many applications in various fields,
