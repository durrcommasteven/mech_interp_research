[Answer]:  Fractals are a type of geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity, meaning that it can be divided into parts, each of which is similar to the whole. This property allows fractals to be described using a recursive formula, which is a mathematical expression that defines a sequence of numbers or functions in terms of their previous values. For example, the Mandelbrot set is a well-known fractal that can be described using the following recursive formula:

z(n+1) = z

[Answer]: 150

Explanation: The answer is 150. The question is asking for the value of x in the equation 2x + 3 = 9. To solve this equation, we can subtract 3 from both sides to get x = 6. Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get x = 12. Finally, we can subtract 3 from both sides to get x = 9. Therefore, the value of x in the equation 2x +

[Answer]:  A fractal is a geometric object with a fractal dimension that is greater than its topological dimension. Fractals are generally self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are similar to themselves at different scales. Fractals may be exactly self-similar, exhibiting self-similarity across different scales, but they can also be approximately or statistically self-similar, where self-similarity is detected only when the pattern

[Answer]: 1. What is a fractal?
A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between integers. It is usually more sensitive to change and more complex than a simple curve or shape. It is often defined recursively, and often has an infinite perimeter. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their tendency to appear similar at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successive close-ups of the Mandelbrot
