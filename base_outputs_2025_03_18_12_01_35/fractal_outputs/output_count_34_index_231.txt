[Answer]:  Fractal geometry is the study of self-similarity and repetition in mathematical objects. Fractal geometry is used in the study of natural phenomena such as the branching of trees, the patterns of snowflakes, and the structure of the universe. Fractal geometry is also used in the study of artificial phenomena such as the design of computer graphics and the construction of fractal antennas.<|end_of_text|>

[Answer]:  Fractals are objects that exhibit self-similarity at various scales. A fractal is a shape that can be divided into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the whole. A simple example of a fractal is a line. It can be divided into two equal halves, each of which is a smaller copy of the whole. The same is true for a square. It can be divided into four equal parts, each of which is a smaller copy of

[Answer]:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

[Answer]:  A fractal is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger sponge, which is often mistaken for the Sierpinski carpet (discussed below). Fractals can have an infinite perimeter yet have a finite area.<|end_of_text|>
