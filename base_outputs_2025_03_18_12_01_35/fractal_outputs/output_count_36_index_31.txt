 <response>Fractal geometry is the study of irregular shapes that are self-similar at different scales. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with patterns that are repeated over and over again, like a fractal. The word "fractal" comes from the Latin word "fractus," which means "broken" or "fragmented." Fractals are often used in computer graphics to create realistic images of natural objects such as mountains, trees, and clouds. They can also be used to create abstract art

 <response>Fractals are shapes that repeat at all scales. A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry.</response>
