1. A sample of 40 observations is selected from a normal population. The sample mean was 51 and the sample standard deviation was 5. Construct a 99% confidence interval estimate of the population mean. (Round your answers to two decimal places.)
Upper limit = __________
Lower limit = __________
2. A sample of 60 observations is selected from a normal population. The sample mean was 18 and the sample standard deviation was 2. Construct a 98

Response: 1. What is the significance of the fact that the $N_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ concentrations are the same in the air you breathe?
Answer:  The significance of the fact that the $N_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ concentrations are the same in the air you breathe is that the two elements are needed in the same ratio to support life.  $N_{2}$ is needed for the formation

Response: 1. The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. The median is the middle number in a set of numbers. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a set of numbers. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. 2. The average of a set of numbers
