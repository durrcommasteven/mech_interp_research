## Output:

--------------- OUTPUTS BELOW ------------
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
A list of possible responses to the prompt

## Steps to solve the problem
1. Use the `nltk` library to tokenize the input sentence into words
2. Use the `nltk` library to remove stop words from the tokenized sentence
3. Use the `nltk` library to lemmatize the tokenized sentence
4. Use the `nltk` library to calculate the similarity between the lemmatized sentence and a set of pre-defined sentences
5
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
 A short summary of the topic

## Algorithm
 1. Ask user for topic
 2. Check if topic is valid
 3. If invalid, ask again
 4. If valid, summarize topic
<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
 A program that will take a string and return the first character of the string in all caps, and the rest of the string in all lowercase. 
<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
 Fractal: Mandelbrot Set

## Description
 This is a fractal generator that generates a Mandelbrot Set. It is written in Python 3. The user can change the size of the fractal by changing the size of the grid and the number of iterations. The program also allows the user to change the colors of the fractal. The colors can be changed by changing the RGB values in the code. The program also allows the user to change the color of the background
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
  A paragraph of text that answers the question.
<|end_of_text|>
