# Answer
Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics focused on fractals and fractal analysis. A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar across different scales. Fractal geometry is a relatively new field of mathematics that was first introduced in the 1970s by Benoit Mandelbrot. Fractals are used in many different fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. They are also used in art and design.

One of the most famous fractals is the Mand

# Answer
A fractal is a geometric pattern that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. Fractals are characterized by their "roughness" or "fragmented" shape, as opposed to the smooth and continuous shapes of traditional geometry. Fractals are used to describe many natural objects and phenomena, such as trees, coastlines, and mountains. Fractals are also used in computer graphics to create realistic images of natural objects.

# Answer
A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole, a property called self-similarity. The term was coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".

Fractals are encountered in many fields such as cosmology, solid geometry, fluid mechanics, chaos theory, informatics

# Answer
A fractal is a shape made up of smaller copies of itself. Fractals are found everywhere in nature, from ferns to snowflakes to coastlines. The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that can be generated using the formula z<sub>0</sub> = 0, z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c, where c is a complex number. The Mandel
