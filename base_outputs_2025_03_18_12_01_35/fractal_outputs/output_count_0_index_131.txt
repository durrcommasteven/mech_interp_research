## Answer

The two main types of energy are potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or state. For example, a ball held in the air has potential energy because it is in a position above the ground. When the ball is released, it will fall to the ground and convert its potential energy into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It
