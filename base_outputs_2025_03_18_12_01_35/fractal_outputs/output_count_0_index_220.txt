AI:  You are correct.  The value of the sum of the interior angles is 180°.  This is because a triangle is a polygon with three sides.  The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is 180(n-2).  For a triangle, n = 3, so the sum of the interior angles is 180(3-2) = 180°.<|end_of_text|>

AI: 1. The study of computer systems that can perform tasks that would require human intelligence if done by a person. 2. The study of making computers behave like humans.

Neural Network: A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus the term is used to denote many types of such networks, which can be either recurrent or non-recurrent and have varied functionality, for pattern recognition or machine learning
