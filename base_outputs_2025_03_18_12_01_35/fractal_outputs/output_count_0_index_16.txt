Assistant:  Let's start with the question.

Question:  Let's say you have a function $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2+1}$$.

And we want to find the derivative of this function.

So we're going to use the quotient rule.

So the quotient rule says that the derivative of this function is going to be equal to the derivative of the numerator times the denominator, minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator, all over the denominator squared.
