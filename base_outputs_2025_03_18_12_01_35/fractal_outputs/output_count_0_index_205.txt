AI:  The term “artificial intelligence” (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.

AI is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is

AI:  A neural network is a machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of a series of interconnected nodes, also known as neurons, that are organized into layers. The input layer receives the data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output layer produces the predicted results.

The nodes in each layer are connected to each other through weighted connections, and the weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the predicted results and the actual results.
