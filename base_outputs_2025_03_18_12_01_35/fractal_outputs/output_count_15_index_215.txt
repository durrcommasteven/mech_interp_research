[Answer]:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

[Answer]:  Fractals are self-similar structures that repeat at different scales. They can be found in nature and have been studied by mathematicians for centuries. One example of a fractal is the Mandelbrot set, which is a set of complex numbers that are defined by a simple iterative formula. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal because it has a self-similar structure that repeats at different scales. The Mandelbrot set is also a good example of a fractal because

[Answer]:  Fractals are a type of complex system that can be used to describe the patterns and structures found in nature. They are characterized by their self-similarity, meaning that they are made up of smaller versions of themselves. This property makes them particularly useful for modeling complex systems, as it allows for the representation of a wide range of phenomena with a single model. Fractals can be used to describe everything from the structure of a snowflake to the behavior of a stock market, and they have

[Answer]:  Fractal is a structure that is self-similar at various scales. It is a never-ending pattern that is produced from repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are characterized by a fractional dimension; that is, if you measure the dimension of a fractal, you get a non-integer number. Fractals are found throughout nature. For example, the branching of trees, the veins in a leaf, the shape of a mountain range, and the coastline
