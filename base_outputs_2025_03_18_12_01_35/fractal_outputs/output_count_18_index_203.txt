# Answer
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems - the pictures of Chaos. Fractals are produced by a process of recursion. The same process is repeated over and over, creating a pattern that is self-similar across different scales. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since

# Answer
Fractals are objects that are self-similar at different scales. They are often generated by a recurrence relation, but this is not a requirement. Fractals are a very broad mathematical concept that can be applied to many different fields. Some examples of fractals include the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, the Koch snowflake, and the Sierpinski triangle. Fractals have been used to model a variety of natural phenomena, including coastlines, river networks, and

# Answer
Fractals are complex geometric shapes that exhibit a property called self-similarity, which means that the shape can be divided into parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term "fractal" was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975, and the study of fractals has since become an important field of mathematics.<|end_of_text|>

# Answer
Fractal is a complex geometric shape that is self-similar across different scales. It is created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. 

Fractals are characterized by a degree of smoothness and a degree of detail. The degree of smoothness is the amount of detail that is present in the shape. The degree of detail is the amount of detail that is present in the shape.

Fractals are used to create complex shapes that are difficult to create with traditional

# Answer
A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. An example of a fractal that is not exactly self-similar is the Koch snowflake. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This is called nearly self
