<|begin_of_text|>

[Answer]: 1

[Explanation]: 

We need to find the missing number in the array. The array is sorted. So, we can use a linear search algorithm to find the missing number. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n).

[Question]: 2

What is the time complexity of the following code?

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        // do
<|begin_of_text|>

[Answer]: <|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

[Answer]: 1. The following code is written in C++ and it is used to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of moves required to reach the end of the maze. The algorithm works by using a stack to keep track of the moves that have been made so far. It starts at the starting point of the maze and adds each move to the stack. If the move leads to a dead end, it is removed from the stack. The algorithm continues until the end of the maze is reached or the
<|begin_of_text|>

[Answer]: <|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>
