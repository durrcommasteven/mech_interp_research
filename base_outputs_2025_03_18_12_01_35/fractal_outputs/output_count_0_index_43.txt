A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that

# A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. The keys can be any object type and the values can be any object type. A hash table is implemented as an array of linked lists, where each linked list represents a bucket. The hash function takes a key and returns an integer that is used to determine which bucket the key belongs to. The value associated with a key is stored in the linked list corresponding to the bucket returned by the hash function.
