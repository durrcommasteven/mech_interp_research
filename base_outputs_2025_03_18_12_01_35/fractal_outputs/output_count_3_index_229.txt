A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar, which means that it is composed of parts that are similar to the whole. Fractals are often used to model natural objects and processes, such as coastlines, trees, and lightning. They can also be used to create abstract art and to generate random numbers.

There are many different types of fractals, but they all have a few things in common. First, they are made up of a small number of simple

Friction is a force that acts on two surfaces that are in contact. It is a force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces that are in contact. Friction is caused by the roughness of the surfaces in contact. The friction force is proportional to the normal force, which is the force that acts perpendicular to the surface in contact. The friction force is given by the formula F_f = \mu N, where F_f is the friction force, \mu is the coefficient
