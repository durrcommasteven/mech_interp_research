Assistant:  I have found the following hints:

* Consider the function $f(x) = \cos(x)$

* Try to find the derivative of $f(x)$

* What is the derivative of $\cos(x)$?

* Use the derivative to find the slope of $f(x)$ at $x = 0$

* What is the slope of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$?

* What is the value of $f(0)$?

* What is the value of

Solution:

We have a very simple problem here. The first thing to note is that the only thing that matters is the total number of steps we take. The order of the steps doesn't matter at all. We can always take steps in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This means that we can always take a step of length 1, then a step of
