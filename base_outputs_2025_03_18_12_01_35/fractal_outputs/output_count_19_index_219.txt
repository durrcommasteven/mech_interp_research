# Answer
A fractal is a geometric object that is self-similar, which means that it is similar to a part of itself. A fractal can be created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of infinitely complex patterns. As mathematical equations, fractals can be used to describe naturally occurring phenomena like coastlines, rivers, mountains, turbulence, and tree branches. Fractals can be used to

# Answer
A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. An example of a non-exact fractal is the coastline of Britain. This is because it is impossible to measure with exact precision. Fractals are encountered in many fields, such

# Answer
Fractals are self-similar patterns that are produced by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are complex patterns which are generally too irregular to be called curves. Designers employ fractals to create images that look natural or organic, as opposed to the hard edges found in many geometric designs. Fractals are used in many areas of art, including architecture, interior design, textiles, and graphic design. Fractal patterns are often seen in nature and are

# Answer
 Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact. Friction can be either static or kinetic. Static friction is a force that acts between two surfaces that are in contact and are not moving relative to each other. Kinetic friction is a force that acts between two surfaces that are in contact and are moving relative to each other. Both types of friction are caused by the interlocking of the surfaces at the atomic level.

Friction is important in many everyday situations. For example

# Answer
Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics focusing on fractals – geometric objects that appear similar at different levels, and that can be subdivided in detail in a recursive fashion. In contrast to calculus, which outputs a single result, fractals tend to output complex, infinite objects. Fractals are encountered in many fields, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory, since the graphs of most chaotic processes are fractals
