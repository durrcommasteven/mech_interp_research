Response: 1. The first step is to determine the type of regression model to use. In this case, it is a linear regression model because the relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variable (x) is assumed to be linear. The second step is to select a suitable regression equation. In this case, the regression equation is: y = β0 + β1x + ε, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept term

Response:  I don't know if this is what you were looking for, but I'm going to assume that you want to find the derivative of a function that is a sum of two functions, f(x) and g(x), where the function is the sum of the two functions, f(x) + g(x). In this case, the derivative of the sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives, so the derivative of f(x) + g(x) is equal to f'(x) +
