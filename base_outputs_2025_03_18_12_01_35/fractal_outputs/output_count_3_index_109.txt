AI:  Fractals are a type of complex geometric pattern that can be generated using a simple mathematical formula. They are characterized by their self-similarity, which means that they look the same at different scales. Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena such as coastlines, river networks, and snowflakes. They can also be used to create interesting and intricate patterns in art and design.

Fractals are generated using a process called iteration, which involves repeatedly applying a mathematical formula to a
