Response: 1. The mean of the population is $M = 100$ and the standard deviation is $\sigma = 10$.

2. The mean of the sample is $\bar{X} = 98$ and the standard deviation of the sample is $s = 10.5$.

3. The null hypothesis is $H_0 : \mu = 100$ and the alternative hypothesis is $H_A : \mu \neq 100$.

4. The test statistic

1. The data is not normally distributed.

2. The data is normally distributed.

3. The data is not normally distributed.

4. The data is normally distributed.

5. The data is not normally distributed.

Explanation: The data is not normally distributed. A normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. The data is not bell-shaped, so it is not normally distributed.

2. The data is normally distributed.

Response: 1. The question is asking us to find the value of $$\displaystyle{f{{\left({x}\right)}}}$$, where $$\displaystyle{f{{\left({x}\right)}}}={x}^{{{2}}}-{2}{x}-{8}$$.
We can solve this problem by using the quadratic formula.
The quadratic formula is: $$\displaystyle{x}=\frac{{-{b}\pm\sqrt{{{b}^{{{2}}}-{
