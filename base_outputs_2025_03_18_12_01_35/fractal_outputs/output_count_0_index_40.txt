--------------- OUTPUTS BELOW ------------
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
```bash
./main.py
```
```bash
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
```
Output: 1
```
## Explanation:

  1. If the input is a string, then we will convert it into a list of characters.
  2. Then we will iterate over each character in the list and if the character is a vowel, then we will add it to the vowels list.
  3. After iterating over all the characters, we will return the vowels list.

## Code:
```
def find_vowels(input):
    vowels = []

<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
```
The following is the output of your program:
Hello, world!
```
## Explanation:
```
The program begins by printing a string to the console. The string is enclosed in double quotes, indicating that it is a string literal. The string contains the phrase "Hello, world!", which is a traditional greeting often used in introductory programming examples.
The print() function is used to print the string to the console. The print() function takes a string as input and prints it to the console
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
```python
'Output: Hello, World!'
```
<|end_of_text|>
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
- A simple text file with the given input as the output
- A simple text file with the given input as the output

## Input:
