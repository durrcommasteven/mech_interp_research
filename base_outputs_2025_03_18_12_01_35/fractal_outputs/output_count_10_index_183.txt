[Answer]:  Fractals are shapes that are self-similar, meaning they are made up of smaller copies of themselves. They can be created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are often used in computer graphics and design, as they can create complex and intricate patterns with relatively few rules. Fractals are also found in nature, such as in the structure of snowflakes, tree branches, and coastlines.<|end_of_text|>

[Answer]:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

[Answer]:  A fractal is a geometric shape that can be divided into parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole, a property called self-similarity. The term was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured". The Mandelbrot set is a famous example of a fractal.<|end_of_text|>
