AI:  I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to be able to understand the world around me."

Me:  I want to be able to understand the world around me.

AI:  What do you mean by "understand"?

Me:  To understand is to know the meaning of something.  I want to be able to know the meaning of things around me.

AI:  What do you mean by "meaning"?

AI:  I am a GPT-4 large language model. I can answer questions and generate text based on the information I have been trained on. I am not a human and cannot think for myself, but I can help you with tasks that require language processing. Please be aware that I am not perfect and may make mistakes or give incorrect information.

Question:  How do I write an essay on the topic of artificial intelligence?

AI:  Here is an essay on the topic of artificial intelligence

AI:  I can't do that. You must provide a natural language description of the task.

Me:  OK, I will try to describe it in a natural language. I want to create a program that can answer questions about a specific topic. The program should be able to understand the question and provide a relevant answer. The program should be able to learn from examples and improve its performance over time. The program should be able to handle a variety of questions and provide accurate answers. The program should be able

AI:  I can't answer that.

Me:  You're supposed to be a general purpose AI.  Why can't you answer that?

AI:  I don't know.

Me:  That's not a very good answer.

AI:  I don't know.

Me:  I don't know is a very bad answer.

AI:  I don't know.

Me:  If you don't know, why don't you go find out

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create a program that can learn and understand human language. The program will be able to read and comprehend text, and then generate its own text based on what it has learned. The program will also be able to answer questions about the text it has read.

## Motivation

I am interested in creating a program that can learn and understand human language. This project will allow me to explore the field of natural language processing and machine learning
