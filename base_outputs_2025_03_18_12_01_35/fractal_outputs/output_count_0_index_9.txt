prompt: ## Input: Explain fractals in 150 words

## Output:

continuation: 

## Output:

newline: 

## Output:

--------------- OUTPUTS BELOW ------------
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
## - A file that contains the output of the program

## Algorithm:
## 1. Open the file and read the contents
## 2. Extract the text from the file
## 3. Use a regular expression to find the words that start with a capital letter
## 4. For each word, check if it is a valid word using the dictionary
## 5. If it is a valid word, add it to a list
## 6. After all the
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
#   - A string of the form "A, B, C, D,... Z" where A, B, C, D,... Z are the letters of the alphabet in order.
#   - A string of the form "A, B, C, D,... Z" where A, B, C, D,... Z are the letters of the alphabet in reverse order.
#   - A string of the form "A, B, C, D,... Z
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
- A list of possible words that could be used to fill in the blank.
- The list should be sorted in descending order based on the number of vowels in the word.
- The list should be sorted in ascending order based on the number of consonants in the word.

## Example:
- Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Output: ["quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "lazy", "dog"]

## Notes:
- The input
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
# 1. Create a function called "get_unique_words"
#   - This function takes in a list of strings and returns a new list of strings containing only the unique words in the original list.
#   - You can assume that the input list will not contain any empty strings.
#   - You can use the "set" data structure to help you solve this problem.
# 2. Create a function called "get_unique_sentences"
#   - This function takes in a list of
<|begin_of_text|>

## Output:
## 1. I want to learn about the Python programming language
## 2. I want to learn about the C programming language
## 3. I want to learn about the Java programming language
## 4. I want to learn about the JavaScript programming language
## 5. I want to learn about the PHP programming language
## 6. I want to learn about the Ruby programming language
## 7. I want to learn about the Swift programming language
