[Answer]:  A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds

[Answer]:  Fractals are objects that are self-similar and infinitely complex. In other words, they are objects that are made up of smaller copies of themselves. Fractals can be found in nature, such as snowflakes, and can also be created artificially, such as with the Mandelbrot set. Fractals are often used to study complex systems, such as the behavior of fluids or the formation of galaxies.<|end_of_text|>

[Answer]:  A fractal is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in the magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that
