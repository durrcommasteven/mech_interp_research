AI:  Fractal geometry is the geometry of the mandelbrot set, perhaps the most famous fractal. Fractal geometry is a mathematical concept that is used to describe patterns that are self-similar and have a fractal dimension. The mandelbrot set is a fractal that is generated by a simple mathematical equation, but it has an infinitely complex structure. The mandelbrot set is a good example of a fractal because it is self-similar and has a fractal dimension.

AI:  Fractal patterns are beautiful and intricate, and can be found in nature. They are formed when a pattern is repeated over and over again, creating a complex and detailed design. Fractals are often used in art and design to create unique and visually appealing patterns.

Fractals can be found in nature in a variety of forms, such as snowflakes, tree branches, and even the shape of galaxies. They are also used in mathematics and physics to model complex systems, such as turbulence and

AI:  Fractal art is a form of abstract art that is created using mathematical formulas. The word "fractal" comes from the Latin word "fractus," which means "broken" or "fragmented." Fractals are mathematical objects that are self-similar, meaning that they have the same shape at all scales. This means that if you zoom in on a fractal, you will see the same pattern repeated over and over again. Fractal art is created by using mathematical formulas to generate images

AI:  A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
