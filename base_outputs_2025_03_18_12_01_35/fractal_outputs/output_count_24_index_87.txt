[Answer]:  Fractal is a self-similar object. It is a mathematical set that is generated by an iterated function system, and it is a geometric shape that is created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are characterized by their self-similarity, which means that they have the same pattern at every scale. This makes them very interesting to mathematicians because they can be used to study the properties of complex systems. Fractals are also used in art

[Answer]:  A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger Sponge. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in the Magnifying Glass graph. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that

[Answer]: 1. A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. A fractal is not the same as a chaotic system, although fractals often are chaotic systems. The non-integer dimension of a fractal is a measure of how fragmented the shape is. Fractals are encountered in many fields, including astronomy, chemistry, ecology, economics, finance, fluid dynamics, geography,

[Answer]:  A fractal is a never ending pattern that repeats itself over and over again at different scales. It is a mathematical object that is self-similar and has a fractal dimension. A fractal can be created by using a recursive algorithm to generate a pattern. Fractals are often used to model natural phenomena such as coastlines, trees, and clouds.

Fractals have a wide range of applications in science, engineering, and art. They are used to model complex systems, to analyze data
