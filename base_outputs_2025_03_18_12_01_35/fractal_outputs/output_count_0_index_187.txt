In order to ensure that the data is clean and accurate, data scientists must use a variety of tools and techniques, such as data cleaning and data validation. Additionally,

# The main idea of the program is to use the `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user to input the number of people in the group, and then use the `if` statement to determine whether the number of people is valid. If the number of people is valid, the program will use the `break` statement to exit the loop and print the number of people. Otherwise, the program will print an error message and ask the user to input the number of people again.
