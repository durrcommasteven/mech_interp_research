AI: 1. In mathematics, the term "limit" refers to the value that a function or sequence approaches as the input or index approaches some value. For example, the limit of the function f(x) = 1/x as x approaches 0 is infinity, meaning that the function approaches infinity as x approaches 0.

2. In computer science, a limit is a constraint on the resources that a program can use, such as memory, processing power, or network bandwidth. For example, a limit

AI:  A computer program that can understand natural language input and generate human-like responses. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and interpret the input, and then generates a response based on the context and meaning of the input.

AI:  Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques for analyzing and understanding natural language, as well as generating natural language output.
