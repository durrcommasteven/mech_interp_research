## Output:
Fractal trees, the Mandelbrot set, and other fractal images are beautiful examples of fractals. Fractals are objects that display self-similarity at various scales. They can be created using a variety of methods, including computer algorithms and mathematical formulas. Fractals have been used to model a wide range of natural phenomena, from coastlines to snowflakes to lightning bolts. They are also used in a variety of applications, from art and design to medicine and engineering.

## Output:
 Fractals are complex geometric shapes that can be created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are characterized by self-similarity, where the same patterns occur at different scales. This makes them useful for modeling natural phenomena such as coastlines, river networks, and mountain ranges.

Fractals have a long history, dating back to the ancient Greeks who studied the properties of curves such as the Fibonacci sequence. In the 19th century, mathematicians

## Output:
 Fractal art is a form of computer graphics created by recursive algorithms. It is a mathematical process that repeats a simple operation over and over in an increasingly complex pattern. The result is a complex, intricate, and often beautiful image. Fractals are often used in art and design, and can be created using a variety of software programs.

## Example
```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the fractal function
def fractal

## Output:
 A short summary of the article you have read and a link to the article

## Example:
 If you read an article about the latest news in the world of technology, you could write a summary about it and share it with your friends.

## Output:
 A short description of the topic, written in the first person, with no more than 300 words. The text should be structured in paragraphs, with a maximum of 3 paragraphs. It should be written in the first person, and should be grammatically correct. The text should be written in a conversational style, and should be free of jargon.

## Example Output:
I have been working in the field of artificial intelligence for over 10 years, and I have seen a lot of changes
