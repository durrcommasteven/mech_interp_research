Assistant:  Friction is the force that opposes the motion of a body over a surface. The force of friction depends on the type of surface, the area of contact, and the speed of the body. The force of friction can be calculated using the formula Ff = μN, where Ff is the force of friction, μ is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force.

Assistant:  Fractal geometry is the branch of mathematics studying fractals. Fractals are geometric shapes that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the whole. They are used to describe and simulate natural objects that do not have smooth or straight edges. Fractals are used in many scientific fields, from mathematics and geometry to finance and cosmology.

Assistant:  The term fractal was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975

The word limit is not a hard limit. If you want to write more than the minimum word limit, that's fine. However, if you want to write less than the minimum word limit, that's fine too. The important thing is to make sure that you're writing enough to answer the question and provide evidence to support your answer.
