[Answer]:  A fractal is a never ending pattern that repeats itself at every scale. They are found in nature, and can be used to describe the shape of clouds, mountains, and coastlines. Fractals can also be generated using mathematical formulas, and are often used in computer graphics and animation.<|end_of_text|>

[Answer]:  Fractals are objects that are self-similar at different scales.  The most famous fractal is the Mandelbrot set, which is the set of complex numbers c for which the function z_(n+1) = z_n^2 + c does not diverge as n goes to infinity.  The Mandelbrot set is a fractal because it is self-similar at different scales.  For example, if you zoom in on a particular part of the Mandel

[Answer]:  A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole. The term was coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning "broken" or "fractured".

Fractals are encountered in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, information technology, geology, sociology, finance, linguistics and music. Fr

[Answer]:  Fractal geometry is a mathematical field that studies geometric shapes and patterns that are self-similar and infinitely complex. Fractals are mathematical objects that exhibit a level of complexity that is not found in traditional Euclidean geometry. Fractals are characterized by their infinite complexity and self-similarity, which means that they are made up of smaller copies of themselves. This property allows fractals to be used to model a wide range of natural phenomena, from the structure of the universe to the behavior of living
