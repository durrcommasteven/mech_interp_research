[Answer]:  A fractal is a geometric object that has a complex structure, and that is self-similar on all scales. This means that if you zoom in on a fractal, you will see the same structure as when you zoom out. This is because fractals are created by iterating a simple function over and over again. For example, the Mandelbrot set is created by iterating the function $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$, where $$c$$ is

[Answer]: 1. What is the definition of a fractal?
A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar across different scales. This means that if you zoom in on a fractal, you will see the same pattern repeated over and over again. Fractals can be created using mathematical formulas, and they often have a complex and intricate structure.

2. What is the Mandelbrot set, and how is it related to fractals?
The Mandelbrot set is a famous

[Answer]: 1. A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers. This means that fractals are too irregular to be captured by traditional metrics and can be split into parts, each of which approximately resembles a reduced-size copy of the whole. The usage of the word fractal was defined this way by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975. The term was coined by Mandelbrot in 1975

[Answer]:  I think fractals are a good example of self-similarity. The image below shows a fractal known as the Mandelbrot set. It is generated by iterating a function on the complex plane and plotting points that converge to a specific value. The points that converge are colored black, and the ones that diverge are colored white. The Mandelbrot set has an infinite number of details, and when you zoom in on it, you see more and more details that are similar
