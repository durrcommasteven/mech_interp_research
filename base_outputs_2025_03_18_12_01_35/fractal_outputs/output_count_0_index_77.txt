AI:  A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task. A computer program can be written in a variety of programming languages, and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex simulations. Computer programs are often used to automate tasks that would be time-consuming or difficult to do by hand.

AI:  The answer to this question depends on the specific context and the intended purpose of the AI system. In general, AI systems are designed to perform tasks that are difficult or impossible for humans to do efficiently or effectively. This includes tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making in complex environments.

AI systems can be used in a wide range of applications, including healthcare, transportation, finance, and entertainment. For example, AI systems can be used to diagnose medical conditions, optimize traffic flow

AI:  The term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalise and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.

AI:  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially

AI:  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

AI:  Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image recognition, the input image goes through several layers of convolutional and pooling layers to gradually identify edges and then more complex features such as eyes
