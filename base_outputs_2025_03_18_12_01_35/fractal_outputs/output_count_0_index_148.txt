Response: Â The graph of the function f (x) = 2x + 4 is a line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 4. The graph of the function g(x) = 3x + 5 is a line with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 5. To find the point of intersection, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.
2x + 4 = 3x +

Response: 1. What is the relationship between the frequency of an electromagnetic wave and its wavelength?
Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other. This means that when the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases, and vice versa.
2. What is the relationship between the frequency of an electromagnetic wave and its energy?
The energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to its frequency. This means that when the frequency increases, the energy of the wave increases.
3. What is the relationship between the frequency of an

Explanation:

The given equation is 2x - 4y = 8.

This equation can be written in the standard form as 2x + 4y = 8.

The standard form of a linear equation is Ax + By = C, where A, B and C are real numbers, and A and B are not both zero.

In the given equation, A = 2, B = 4 and C = 8.
