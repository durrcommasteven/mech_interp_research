# Answer
The answer is that the two terms are not equivalent, but they are very close. In fact, the difference between them is often referred to as the "bias" of the estimator. The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true value of the parameter being estimated. So, if the bias is small, then the estimator is said to be unbiased.

However, there are some cases where the bias can be large, and in these cases, the estimator is
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
A computer program is a sequence of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a specific task. The instructions are written in a programming language, which is a set of rules and commands that the computer understands.

The program is written in a text editor and saved as a file with a specific extension, such as.py for Python or.java for Java. The program can then be executed by a computer, which will follow the instructions and perform the desired task.

For example, a program could be written
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
The answer to this question is simple, the answer is **"You can't"**. This is because there is no such thing as a "perfect" answer to this question. Each person has their own unique perspective on what constitutes a perfect answer, and what is considered a perfect answer may vary from person to person. Additionally, the context of the question is important, as the answer to this question may depend on the situation and the individual's needs. Therefore, it is impossible to give a
<|begin_of_text|>

# Answer
The answer is a program that takes an input string, and outputs the number of unique characters in the string.

The program uses a hash map to store the characters and their counts. It iterates over the input string, and for each character, it checks if the character is already in the hash map. If it is, it increments the count for that character. If it's not, it adds the character to the hash map with a count of 1.

After iterating over the entire string,
