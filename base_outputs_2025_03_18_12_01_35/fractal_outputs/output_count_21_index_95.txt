 <response>Fractal is a word that means something that is self-similar across different scales. For example, a fern is a fractal because if you zoom in on a small part of the fern, it looks just like the whole fern. Fractals are important in physics because they can be used to model things like turbulence and fluid flow. They are also used in computer graphics to create realistic images of natural phenomena.</response>

 <response>Fractal geometry is a field of mathematics dealing with fractals. Fractals are geometric shapes that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the whole. They are used to describe and model structures (such as clouds) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and which exhibit a degree of self-similarity (a property having a similar view at all scales).</response>

 <response>Fractal trees are a type of fractal that are created by recursively dividing a triangle into smaller triangles. The resulting shape is a fractal because it has a self-similar structure, meaning that it can be divided into smaller copies of itself. Fractal trees are often used in art and design to create complex and intricate patterns.</response>
