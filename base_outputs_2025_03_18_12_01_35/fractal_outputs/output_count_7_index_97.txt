Assistant:  Fractals are complex geometric shapes that are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Fractals are characterized by self-similarity, which means that they look similar at different levels of magnification. This self-similarity can be seen in the structure of many natural objects, such as snowflakes, trees, and coastlines. Fractals can also be used to model complex systems, such as the stock market and the weather.

Assistant:  Fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales. They are created by mathematical equations that describe the way that a pattern repeats itself over and over again. Fractals can be used to describe natural phenomena, such as the branching of trees or the structure of snowflakes, and they can also be used to create interesting and complex patterns.

Fractals can be created using a variety of different mathematical equations. One common equation used to create fractals is the Mandelbrot set. The
