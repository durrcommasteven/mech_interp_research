1. What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?

A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that is proposed for the answer to a research question. A theory is a collection of related hypotheses that provide a framework for understanding the phenomenon of interest. Theories are typically developed through the systematic testing of hypotheses and the accumulation of evidence. Theories are also used to guide future research by identifying gaps in knowledge and suggesting new directions for investigation.

Response:  A fractal is a shape that repeats itself. For example, a snowflake has a fractal shape because the shape of the snowflake is the same as the shape of the snowflake's branches. The fractal shape is a result of the way the snowflake is formed. The snowflake is formed by the process of freezing water droplets. As the water freezes, it forms a hexagon shape. This hexagon shape is the same shape as the snowflake's branches. The branches

A hypothesis is a prediction about how a variable will change in response to a change in another variable. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in hypothesis testing. It is used to determine whether the results of an experiment are statistically significant or not. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no difference between the means of two populations. The alternative hypothesis is a statement that there is a difference between the means of two populations. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a
