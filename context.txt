What are the key elements of photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is the process where plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in chloroplasts containing chlorophyll, which captures light energy. The process includes light-dependent reactions producing ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle that uses these to fix carbon dioxide into sugar.

What is quantum computing explained in simple terms?

Quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits. This quantum superposition allows quantum computers to process certain complex problems exponentially faster than traditional computers. Applications include cryptography, optimization problems, and simulating quantum systems.
