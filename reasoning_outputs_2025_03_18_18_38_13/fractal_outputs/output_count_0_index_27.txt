Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You need to determine the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 4 = 10 \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
Start by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
2x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4
\]
