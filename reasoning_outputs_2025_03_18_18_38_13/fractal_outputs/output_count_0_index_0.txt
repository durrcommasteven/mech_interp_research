Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \(2x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from school that there are a couple of ways to solve quadratic equations like this one. One is factoring, and another is using the quadratic formula. I'm not sure which one to use here, so maybe I'll try both methods and see which one works.

First, let

Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve the equation \( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \). Hmm, I remember from algebra that this is a quadratic equation, and there are a few ways to solve it. Let me think about which method would be best here.

First, I recall the quadratic formula, which is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)

Alright, so I need to figure out how to calculate the area of a circle. I've heard that the area is related to the radius or diameter, but I'm not exactly sure how. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that a circle is a set of all points that are equidistant from a central point, which is the center of the circle. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius, denoted by '

Alright, so I need to figure out how to make a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've heard that HTML is for structure, CSS is for styling, and JavaScript is for functionality. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with the HTML structure. I know I need a display area where the numbers will show up, and buttons for numbers and operations. Maybe I'll use a div for the display and another div for the buttons. Each

Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this equation: 3 times x equals 2 times y, and then find x in terms of y. Hmm, let me start by writing down the equation as it is: 3x = 2y. 

Alright, the goal is to solve for x, which means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, x is being multiplied by 3, so to get rid of that
