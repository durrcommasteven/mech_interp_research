Fructose is a type of sugar found in various foods such as fruits, vegetables, and honey. It is known as a "free sugar" because it is not bonded to other molecules, unlike some other sugars like sucrose, which is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.

One of the key differences between glucose and fructose is their metabolism. Glucose is the primary energy source for cells and is metabolized in the mitochondria, while fructose is metabolized in the

Fructose, a type of sugar, is naturally present in various foods such as fruits, honey, and sweeteners. It's known for its sweet taste and is often used in cooking, baking, and as a sweetener in beverages. Fructose can be classified into two main forms: glufructose and levulose, which are both monosaccharides and are absorbed similarly to table sugar. However, they have slightly different physical and chemical properties, which can affect their usage in different

Fructose, a type of sugar, is naturally present in various foods and is often used in processed items. It's known for its sweet taste and is commonly found in fruits like apples, pears, and grapes. In processed foods, it's added to enhance sweetness, improve texture, and extend shelf life. However, consuming excessive amounts of fructose can lead to health issues, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, and liver damage, especially when consumed in high quantities or in the form of
